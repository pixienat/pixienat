<h1 id="Assignment-5">Assignment 5<a class="anchor-link" href="#Assignment-5">&#182;</a></h1><p>In this assignment, you'll scrape text from <a href="https://theaggie.org/">The California Aggie</a> and then analyze the text.</p>
<p>The Aggie is organized by category into article lists. For example, there's a <a href="https://theaggie.org/campus/">Campus News</a> list, <a href="https://theaggie.org/arts/">Arts &amp; Culture</a> list, and <a href="https://theaggie.org/sports/">Sports</a> list. Notice that each list has multiple pages, with a maximum of 15 articles per page.</p>
<p>The goal of exercises 1.1 - 1.3 is to scrape articles from the Aggie for analysis in exercise 1.4.</p>

    'text': u'Davis residents create financial model to make city\'s financial state more transparent To increase transparency between the city\'s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\' Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. "City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\'s potential financial position over the long term," Stachowicz said in an email interview. "We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond." Project Toto complements the city\'s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\'s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand. The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\'s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments "This really isn\'t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions," Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. "What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?" Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto. "It\'s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation," Mayor Robb Davis said. "You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city." Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\'s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. "It\'s something I have been very much supportive of," Davis said. "Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [ ] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation."

<pre>{&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Negative effects of vaping explored by UC NewsroomWritten by: Harnoor Gill \u2014 science@theaggie.org&#39;,
 &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;Within the past century, smoking cigarettes was advised by physicians as a method of keeping a slim figure. The health effects of this were disastrous and progressive awareness campaigns were launched that gradually brought the smoking rate to its current &#39;,
  &#39; in the U.S. Recently, the UC Newsroom investigated a similar and potentially just as dangerous contender that has joined the smoking room: electronic cigarettes.&#39;,
  u&#39;E-cigarettes, also known as vapes or e-hookahs, are devices that heat a nicotine-containing liquid into an aerosol that the user inhales. What many vapers may not realize is that, besides nicotine, e-cigarettes can contain potentially harmful ingredients including chemicals known to cause heart and lung disease, heavy metals, carcinogens and other ultrafine particles. Though advertised as \u201c&#39;,
  u&#39;\u201d by the e-cigarette industry, this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.&#39;,
  u&#39;\u201cWe are learning more about the health impacts of inhaling vapor, or aerosol and secondhand vapor,\u201d said Elisa Tong, UC Davis assistant professor of general medicine who works with UC Quits, a tobacco cessation network across the five UC medical campuses. \u201cIt is not water vapor but propylene glycol that contains other chemicals [nicotine, flavorings, additives] and particles.\u201d&#39;,
  &#39;The sleek design and technological sophistication are just a couple of factors that contribute to a cloud of appeal and normalcy around the notorious e-cigarette. The media, which heavily influences the perception of products on the market, has also played a critical role in skyrocketing popularity.&#39;,
  u&#39;\u201cEvery single big tobacco company has at least one e-cigarette brand. Since e-cigarettes had not been regulated, they used many of the same advertising tactics that they did for cigarettes years ago,\u201d Tong said. \u201cCertainly this includes getting product placement and celebrity endorsements that are advertised through the media.\u201d&#39;,
  u&#39;Along with this, a plethora of attractive flavors, such as \u201cSmurf Cake\u201d and \u201cFruit Hoops,\u201d often make it appear as though you are purchasing a pack of bubblegum rather than a harmful nicotine product. These flavors, though edible, can be harmful when inhaled. Diacetyl, a chemical linked to lung disease, is an example of a common flavorant in e-cigarettes, according to the &#39;,
  &#39;Besides the negative long-term health effects, e-cigarettes also have explosive tendencies.&#39;,
  u&#39; \u201cBatteries used in e-cigarettes have been known to explode causing burns and damage to teeth,\u201d said Diana Cassady, a UC Davis professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences in an email interview. \xa0&#39;,
  u&#39;Another indisputable problem with e-cigarettes is that they continue to fuel smokers\u2019 nicotine addictions, an unfortunate effect considering that many try to use them to wean themselves off of traditional cigarettes.&#39;,
  u&#39;\u201cA puff on an e-cigarette is not as dangerous as a puff on a regular cigarette,\u201d said tobacco control activist Stanton Glantz.&#39;,
  u&#39;\u201cThe most important negative effect of vaping is that they keep people smoking conventional cigarettes. They reduce the likelihood that a smoker will quit by a third.\u201d&#39;,
  &#39;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends FDA-approved nicotine replacement products, such as skin patches and chewing gum, for current smokers wishing to quit. The &#39;,
  u&#39; also revealed that the use of e-cigarettes is \u201chigher among high school students than adults.\u201d \xa0&#39;,
  &#39;Despite rising e-cigarette popularity, states such as Hawaii and California have given their citizens reason to take in a breath of fresh air by officially declaring e-cigarettes as tobacco products and issuing regulations on their use, such as setting the minor age of consumption at 21. &#39;],

<pre>[{&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Local Whole Foods closes Feb. 12Written by: Kaelyn Tuermer-Lee \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.&#39;,
   u&#39;The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Food\u2019s locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joe\u2019s and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.&#39;,
   &#39;Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThat\u2019s why it closed down \u2013\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\u2019s, to grow.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI\u2019d love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s something that we critically need,\u201d said Mayor Robb Davis.&#39;,
   &#39;And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt just feels out of place, not having a Whole Foods in Davis,\u201d Pasturel said.&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Demonstrations take place at hundreds of Planned Parenthood locations nationwideWritten By: Anya Rehon \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthood\u2019s in-clinic abortion services. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for women\u2019s rights. &#39;,
   u&#39;Over 80 individuals RSVP\u2019d to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.&#39;,
   u&#39;This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as \u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood\u201d and \u201cnot your body, not your business.\u201d Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for women\u2019s health,\u201d said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. \u201cIt provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2014-2015 &#39;,
   u&#39;, of the \u201c9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. &#39;,
   &#39;Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cMy two daughters go to the clinic,\u201d Rodriquez said. \u201cTheir school is teaching them information about women\u2019s health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, \u201cHoly Mary, pray for our sinners.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;At UC Davis\u2019 Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are &#39;,
   &#39;.&#39;,
   &#39;Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance. &#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;California Redevelopment Agencies require Davis to sell Historic City HallWritten By: Bianca Antunez \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the &#39;,
   &#39;Davis Joint Unified School District&#39;,
   &#39; or Yolo County services. &#39;,
   &#39;California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the state\u2019s orders,\u201d said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. \u201cWe are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. &#39;,
   u&#39;Davis\u2019 Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cDavis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall,\u201d said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. \u201cLocated at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. &#39;,
   &#39;Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to &#39;,
   &#39;the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.&#39;,
   &#39;That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. &#39;,
   u&#39;While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the city\u2019s Historic Resource Management Commission.&#39;,
   u&#39;While there hasn\u2019t been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. &#39;,
   u&#39;Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the city\u2019s history. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWe have to demonstrate to the state that we are maximizing revenue from that sale,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt would be difficult for us to demonstrate that we are purchasing it at market [value] if we get it at a rate that we can potentially afford so we are unanimous in saying that it should be sold at market rate.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis residents show solidarity in wake of travel ban, vandalismWritten by: Caitlyn Sampley \u2014 city@theaggie.org&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.&#39;,
   &#39;Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the &#39;,
   u&#39;, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administration\u2019s list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.&#39;,
   u&#39;In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community,\u201d said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.&#39;,
   &#39;In the wake of a &#39;,
   u&#39; at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading \u201cwe support you.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cThere is no longer this predominating attitude that, \u2018well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion\u2019.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.&#39;,
   u&#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, \u201cUC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThere is still a lot of hateful sentiment,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cThis weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\u201d Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.&#39;,
   u&#39;On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with \u201cvery little changes.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cAfter you reach out, get involved,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cAttend events, talks, panels, protests, and educate yourself. There is no shortage of people to talk to. Do not be shy. Be open minded and open hearted.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;CalRecycle donates $197,851&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units,\u201d said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. &#39;,
   &#39;With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOur parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\u201d Gilbert said. &#39;,
   &#39;To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. &#39;,
   &#39;In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. &#39;,
   &#39;Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. &#39;,
   &#39;According to the CalRecycle&#39;,
   u&#39;, \u201cDuring the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. &#39;,
   &#39;Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIn the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\u201d said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.&#39;,
   u&#39;To help the campus reach its goal, Vang recommended that students make an effort to compost more \u2014 not just food, but napkins and other items as well. She\u2019s hoping that she can bring more composting collection services to the Coffee House later this spring. &#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;Mayor Robb Davis reaffirms that the City of Davis will not make any policy changes&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as \u201csanctuary jurisdictions.\u201d \u201cSanctuary jurisdiction\u201d is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies.&#39;,
   u&#39;The controversial executive order, titled \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\u201d was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.&#39;,
   &#39;The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city&#39;,
   &#39;, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&#39;,
   u&#39;Davis explained that the City of Davis\u2019 sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\u2019s [immigration] status in any interaction [\u2026] This is something that we\u2019ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\u2019re not fearful of contacting the police,\u201d Davis said. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;Davis believes that President Trump\u2019s executive order will make cities less safe.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cImagine if you\u2019re someone who is brought to this country, and you\u2019ve been trafficked and you\u2019re not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trump\u2019s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\u201d Davis said.&#39;,
   &#39;According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOur police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\u2019re acting,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any concerns about the administration\u2019s threats [\u2026] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke&#39;,
   u&#39; We\u2019re not in a position where we\u2019re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\u2019 affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\u2019s the President of the United States. It\u2019s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \u2018no, we\u2019re not going to pass any of his bills\u2019 [\u2026] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\u201d Casas said.&#39;,
   u&#39;Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\u2019 stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cFor somebody to come around asking random questions like \u2018Hey, are you a citizen here?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of none of their business. If they\u2019re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\u2019t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\u2019m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [\u2026] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\u201d Angel-Gonzalez said.&#39;,
   &#39;Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis &#39;,
   &#39; by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&#39;,
   u&#39;The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\u2019s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\u2019s license without proof of legal residence. &#39;,
   &#39;The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.&#39;,
   u&#39;The legality of President Trump\u2019s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.&#39;],

  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism &#39;,
   &#39;, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. &#39;,
   u&#39;The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \u201cSoon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\u201d &#39;,
   u&#39;Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelho\u2019s arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. \xa0&#39;,
   &#39;The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cVideo footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle,\u201d said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.&#39;,
   u&#39;Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cPolitical, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes,\u201d said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest. &#39;,
   &#39; Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. &#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis residents create financial model to make city\u2019s financial state more transparent&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;To increase transparency between the city\u2019s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. &#39;,
   u&#39;Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\u2019 Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cCity staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\u2019s potential financial position over the long term,\u201d Stachowicz said in an email interview. \u201cWe all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Project Toto complements the city\u2019s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\u2019s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.&#39;,
   u&#39;The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\u2019s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThis really isn\u2019t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\u201d Williams said in an interview with The &#39;,
   u&#39;. \u201cWhat happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. &#39;,
   &#39;The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said. \u201cYou can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\u2019s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. &#39;,
   &#39;There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s something I have been very much supportive of,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTransparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [\u2026] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\u201d&#39;],

   &#39;The fundraiser is a part of a project to continue caring for and restoring the historic community cemetery located at 820 Pole Line Road. &#39;,
   &#39;Ashley Wilson*, a Davis resident whose grandfather is buried at the cemetery, said that she thinks the fundraiser will welcome families to continue thinking of their loved ones and keep them from forgetting about them. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI like the idea of the fundraiser,\u201d Wilson said. \xa0\u201cI think it\u2019s a warm gesture. I know for me it reminds me of how much my grandfather liked to give us roses on Valentine\u2019s Day when I was younger.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Each flowerpot will cost $15 or loved ones can purchase two for $20. On Valentine\u2019s Day, staff will place the flowerpots on the gravesites. The flower arrangements themselves will follow the traditional color of Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 red. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cEach arrangement will feature vibrant Bellisima Red English daisy in a beautiful environmentally friendly four-inch Ecoform pot.

The plants are specifically suited to bear the climate of Yolo County. The cemetery also features Gallery 1855, an art gallery located on the grounds. &#39;,
   &#39;According to the Davis Cemetery District and Arboretum &#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimer\u2019s patients at Yolo Hospice&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. &#39;,
   u&#39; have shown that patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.&#39;,
   &#39;In order to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe grant was wonderful and very generous,\u201d said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \u201cIt does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesn\u2019t affect patients\u2019 ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cYou figure out an individual\u2019s specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre,\u201d said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. \u201cIt\u2019s more about them connecting to their past in their music.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Although music isn\u2019t said to be a complete cure for Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, it does help \xa0bring some of the patients\u2019 memories back for the time being.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201c[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cMedication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life.\u201d &#39;,
   u&#39;The Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cAlive Inside\u201d is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music &amp; Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award. &#39;,
   &#39;There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional &#39;,
   &#39;, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods,\u201d said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. \u201cThese personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;Burrowing Owl Preservation Society sues City of Davis for improper assessment of environmental impact of Marriott hotel&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The Burrowing Owl Preservation Society (BOPS), which aims to educate the public and support conservation efforts for our feathered friends, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 5 against the City of Davis for its insufficient report on the environmental implications of the Marriott Residence Inn building site.&#39;,
   &#39;A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.&#39;,
   &#39;In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.&#39;,
   &#39;Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.&#39;,
   &#39;Janet Foley, a &#39;,
   &#39;professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\u201d Foley said. &#39;,
   &#39;\n&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.&#39;,
   u&#39;The complaint called into question the city council\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\u2019 leadership. The council\u2019s MND called for \u201cpassive relocation\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cPassive relocation\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\u201d&#39;],

  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. &#39;,
   &#39;The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.&#39;,
   u&#39;According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\u201d \xa0&#39;,
   &#39;Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event,\u201d Davis said.&#39;,
   u&#39;A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. King\u2019s beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in today\u2019s political environment.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cToday\u2019s theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cFor, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, \u2018Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.\u2019\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic \u201cFreedom March\u201d through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march.&#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Local Whole Foods closes Feb. 12Written by: Kaelyn Tuermer-Lee \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.&#39;,
   u&#39;The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Food\u2019s locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joe\u2019s and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.&#39;,
   &#39;Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThat\u2019s why it closed down \u2013\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\u2019s, to grow.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI\u2019d love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s something that we critically need,\u201d said Mayor Robb Davis.&#39;,
   &#39;And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt just feels out of place, not having a Whole Foods in Davis,\u201d Pasturel said.&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Demonstrations take place at hundreds of Planned Parenthood locations nationwideWritten By: Anya Rehon \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthood\u2019s in-clinic abortion services. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for women\u2019s rights. &#39;,
   u&#39;Over 80 individuals RSVP\u2019d to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.&#39;,
   u&#39;This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as \u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood\u201d and \u201cnot your body, not your business.\u201d Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for women\u2019s health,\u201d said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. \u201cIt provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2014-2015 &#39;,
   u&#39;, of the \u201c9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. &#39;,
   &#39;Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cMy two daughters go to the clinic,\u201d Rodriquez said. \u201cTheir school is teaching them information about women\u2019s health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, \u201cHoly Mary, pray for our sinners.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;At UC Davis\u2019 Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are &#39;,
   &#39;.&#39;,
   &#39;Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance. &#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;California Redevelopment Agencies require Davis to sell Historic City HallWritten By: Bianca Antunez \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the &#39;,
   &#39;Davis Joint Unified School District&#39;,
   &#39; or Yolo County services. &#39;,
   &#39;California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the state\u2019s orders,\u201d said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. \u201cWe are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. &#39;,
   u&#39;Davis\u2019 Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cDavis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall,\u201d said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. \u201cLocated at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. &#39;,
   &#39;Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to &#39;,
   &#39;the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.&#39;,
   &#39;That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. &#39;,
   u&#39;While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the city\u2019s Historic Resource Management Commission.&#39;,
   u&#39;While there hasn\u2019t been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. &#39;,
   u&#39;Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the city\u2019s history. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWe have to demonstrate to the state that we are maximizing revenue from that sale,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt would be difficult for us to demonstrate that we are purchasing it at market [value] if we get it at a rate that we can potentially afford so we are unanimous in saying that it should be sold at market rate.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis residents show solidarity in wake of travel ban, vandalismWritten by: Caitlyn Sampley \u2014 city@theaggie.org&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.&#39;,
   &#39;Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the &#39;,
   u&#39;, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administration\u2019s list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.&#39;,
   u&#39;In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community,\u201d said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.&#39;,
   &#39;In the wake of a &#39;,
   u&#39; at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading \u201cwe support you.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cThere is no longer this predominating attitude that, \u2018well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion\u2019.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.&#39;,
   u&#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, \u201cUC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThere is still a lot of hateful sentiment,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cThis weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\u201d Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.&#39;,

  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units,\u201d said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. &#39;,
   &#39;With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOur parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\u201d Gilbert said. &#39;,
   &#39;To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. &#39;,
   &#39;In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. &#39;,
   &#39;Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. &#39;,
   &#39;According to the CalRecycle&#39;,
   u&#39;, \u201cDuring the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. &#39;,
   &#39;Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIn the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\u201d said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.&#39;,
   u&#39;To help the campus reach its goal, Vang recommended that students make an effort to compost more \u2014 not just food, but napkins and other items as well. She\u2019s hoping that she can bring more composting collection services to the Coffee House later this spring. &#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;Mayor Robb Davis reaffirms that the City of Davis will not make any policy changes&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as \u201csanctuary jurisdictions.\u201d \u201cSanctuary jurisdiction\u201d is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies.&#39;,
   u&#39;The controversial executive order, titled \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\u201d was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.&#39;,
   &#39;The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city&#39;,
   &#39;, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&#39;,
   u&#39;Davis explained that the City of Davis\u2019 sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\u2019s [immigration] status in any interaction [\u2026] This is something that we\u2019ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\u2019re not fearful of contacting the police,\u201d Davis said. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;Davis believes that President Trump\u2019s executive order will make cities less safe.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cImagine if you\u2019re someone who is brought to this country, and you\u2019ve been trafficked and you\u2019re not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trump\u2019s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\u201d Davis said.&#39;,
   &#39;According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOur police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\u2019re acting,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any concerns about the administration\u2019s threats [\u2026] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke&#39;,
   u&#39; We\u2019re not in a position where we\u2019re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\u2019 affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\u2019s the President of the United States. It\u2019s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \u2018no, we\u2019re not going to pass any of his bills\u2019 [\u2026] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\u201d Casas said.&#39;,
   u&#39;Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\u2019 stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cFor somebody to come around asking random questions like \u2018Hey, are you a citizen here?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of none of their business. If they\u2019re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\u2019t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\u2019m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [\u2026] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\u201d Angel-Gonzalez said.&#39;,
   &#39;Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis &#39;,
   &#39; by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&#39;,
   u&#39;The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\u2019s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\u2019s license without proof of legal residence. &#39;,
   &#39;The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.&#39;,
   u&#39;The legality of President Trump\u2019s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis resident Lauren Kirk-Coehlo arrested in connection with hate crimeWritten by: Samantha Solomon \u2014 city@theaggie.org&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism &#39;,
   &#39;, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. &#39;,
   u&#39;The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \u201cSoon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\u201d &#39;,
   u&#39;Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelho\u2019s arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. \xa0&#39;,
   &#39;The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cVideo footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle,\u201d said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.&#39;,
   u&#39;Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cPolitical, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes,\u201d said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest. &#39;,
   &#39; Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOn behalf of the Muslim community in Davis, we would like to thank you for your contribution to help repair our Masjid,\u201d said Omar Awad, UC Davis Muslim Student Association president and Shifa Community Clinic volunteer, on the &#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis residents create financial model to make city\u2019s financial state more transparent&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;To increase transparency between the city\u2019s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. &#39;,
   u&#39;Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\u2019 Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cCity staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\u2019s potential financial position over the long term,\u201d Stachowicz said in an email interview. \u201cWe all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Project Toto complements the city\u2019s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\u2019s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.&#39;,
   u&#39;The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\u2019s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThis really isn\u2019t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\u201d Williams said in an interview with The &#39;,
   u&#39;. \u201cWhat happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. &#39;,
   &#39;The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said. \u201cYou can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\u2019s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. &#39;,
   &#39;There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s something I have been very much supportive of,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTransparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [\u2026] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\u201d&#39;],

   &#39;The fundraiser is a part of a project to continue caring for and restoring the historic community cemetery located at 820 Pole Line Road. &#39;,
   &#39;Ashley Wilson*, a Davis resident whose grandfather is buried at the cemetery, said that she thinks the fundraiser will welcome families to continue thinking of their loved ones and keep them from forgetting about them. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI like the idea of the fundraiser,\u201d Wilson said. \xa0\u201cI think it\u2019s a warm gesture. I know for me it reminds me of how much my grandfather liked to give us roses on Valentine\u2019s Day when I was younger.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Each flowerpot will cost $15 or loved ones can purchase two for $20. On Valentine\u2019s Day, staff will place the flowerpots on the gravesites. The flower arrangements themselves will follow the traditional color of Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 red. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cEach arrangement will feature vibrant Bellisima Red English daisy in a beautiful environmentally friendly four-inch Ecoform pot.

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimer\u2019s patients at Yolo Hospice&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. &#39;,
   u&#39; have shown that patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.&#39;,
   &#39;In order to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe grant was wonderful and very generous,\u201d said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \u201cIt does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesn\u2019t affect patients\u2019 ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cYou figure out an individual\u2019s specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre,\u201d said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. \u201cIt\u2019s more about them connecting to their past in their music.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Although music isn\u2019t said to be a complete cure for Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, it does help \xa0bring some of the patients\u2019 memories back for the time being.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201c[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cMedication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life.\u201d &#39;,
   u&#39;The Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cAlive Inside\u201d is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music &amp; Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award. &#39;,
   &#39;There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional &#39;,
   &#39;, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods,\u201d said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. \u201cThese personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories.\u201d&#39;],

The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.&#39;,
   &#39;In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.&#39;,
   &#39;Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.&#39;,
   &#39;Janet Foley, a &#39;,
   &#39;professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\u201d Foley said. &#39;,
   &#39;\n&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.&#39;,
   u&#39;The complaint called into question the city council\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\u2019 leadership. The council\u2019s MND called for \u201cpassive relocation\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cPassive relocation\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\u201d&#39;],

  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. &#39;,
   &#39;The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.&#39;,
   u&#39;According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\u201d \xa0&#39;,
   &#39;Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event,\u201d Davis said.&#39;,
   u&#39;A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. King\u2019s beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in today\u2019s political environment.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cToday\u2019s theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cFor, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, \u2018Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.\u2019\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic \u201cFreedom March\u201d through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march.&#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Local Whole Foods closes Feb. 12Written by: Kaelyn Tuermer-Lee \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.&#39;,
   u&#39;The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Food\u2019s locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joe\u2019s and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.&#39;,
   &#39;Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThat\u2019s why it closed down \u2013\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\u2019s, to grow.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI\u2019d love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s something that we critically need,\u201d said Mayor Robb Davis.&#39;,
   &#39;And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt just feels out of place, not having a Whole Foods in Davis,\u201d Pasturel said.&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Demonstrations take place at hundreds of Planned Parenthood locations nationwideWritten By: Anya Rehon \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthood\u2019s in-clinic abortion services. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for women\u2019s rights. &#39;,
   u&#39;Over 80 individuals RSVP\u2019d to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.&#39;,
   u&#39;This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as \u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood\u201d and \u201cnot your body, not your business.\u201d Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for women\u2019s health,\u201d said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. \u201cIt provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2014-2015 &#39;,
   u&#39;, of the \u201c9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. &#39;,
   &#39;Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cMy two daughters go to the clinic,\u201d Rodriquez said. \u201cTheir school is teaching them information about women\u2019s health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, \u201cHoly Mary, pray for our sinners.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;At UC Davis\u2019 Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are &#39;,
   &#39;.&#39;,
   &#39;Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance. &#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;California Redevelopment Agencies require Davis to sell Historic City HallWritten By: Bianca Antunez \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the &#39;,
   &#39;Davis Joint Unified School District&#39;,
   &#39; or Yolo County services. &#39;,
   &#39;California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the state\u2019s orders,\u201d said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. \u201cWe are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. &#39;,
   u&#39;Davis\u2019 Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cDavis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall,\u201d said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. \u201cLocated at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. &#39;,
   &#39;Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to &#39;,
   &#39;the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.&#39;,
   &#39;That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. &#39;,
   u&#39;While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the city\u2019s Historic Resource Management Commission.&#39;,
   u&#39;While there hasn\u2019t been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. &#39;,
   u&#39;Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the city\u2019s history. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWe have to demonstrate to the state that we are maximizing revenue from that sale,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt would be difficult for us to demonstrate that we are purchasing it at market [value] if we get it at a rate that we can potentially afford so we are unanimous in saying that it should be sold at market rate.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis residents show solidarity in wake of travel ban, vandalismWritten by: Caitlyn Sampley \u2014 city@theaggie.org&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.&#39;,
   &#39;Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the &#39;,
   u&#39;, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administration\u2019s list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.&#39;,
   u&#39;In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community,\u201d said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.&#39;,
   &#39;In the wake of a &#39;,
   u&#39; at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading \u201cwe support you.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cThere is no longer this predominating attitude that, \u2018well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion\u2019.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.&#39;,
   u&#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, \u201cUC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThere is still a lot of hateful sentiment,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cThis weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\u201d Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.&#39;,
   u&#39;On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with \u201cvery little changes.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cAfter you reach out, get involved,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cAttend events, talks, panels, protests, and educate yourself. There is no shortage of people to talk to. Do not be shy. Be open minded and open hearted.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;CalRecycle donates $197,851&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units,\u201d said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. &#39;,
   &#39;With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOur parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\u201d Gilbert said. &#39;,
   &#39;To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. &#39;,
   &#39;In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. &#39;,
   &#39;Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. &#39;,
   &#39;According to the CalRecycle&#39;,
   u&#39;, \u201cDuring the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. &#39;,
   &#39;Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIn the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\u201d said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.&#39;,
   u&#39;To help the campus reach its goal, Vang recommended that students make an effort to compost more \u2014 not just food, but napkins and other items as well. She\u2019s hoping that she can bring more composting collection services to the Coffee House later this spring. &#39;],

   u&#39;Davis explained that the City of Davis\u2019 sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\u2019s [immigration] status in any interaction [\u2026] This is something that we\u2019ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\u2019re not fearful of contacting the police,\u201d Davis said. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;Davis believes that President Trump\u2019s executive order will make cities less safe.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cImagine if you\u2019re someone who is brought to this country, and you\u2019ve been trafficked and you\u2019re not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trump\u2019s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\u201d Davis said.&#39;,
   &#39;According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOur police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\u2019re acting,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any concerns about the administration\u2019s threats [\u2026] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke&#39;,
   u&#39; We\u2019re not in a position where we\u2019re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\u2019 affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\u2019s the President of the United States. It\u2019s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \u2018no, we\u2019re not going to pass any of his bills\u2019 [\u2026] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\u201d Casas said.&#39;,
   u&#39;Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\u2019 stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cFor somebody to come around asking random questions like \u2018Hey, are you a citizen here?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of none of their business. If they\u2019re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\u2019t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\u2019m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [\u2026] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\u201d Angel-Gonzalez said.&#39;,
   &#39;Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis &#39;,
   &#39; by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&#39;,
   u&#39;The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\u2019s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\u2019s license without proof of legal residence. &#39;,
   &#39;The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.&#39;,
   u&#39;The legality of President Trump\u2019s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.&#39;],

  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism &#39;,
   &#39;, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. &#39;,
   u&#39;The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \u201cSoon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\u201d &#39;,
   u&#39;Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelho\u2019s arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. \xa0&#39;,
   &#39;The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cVideo footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle,\u201d said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.&#39;,
   u&#39;Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cPolitical, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes,\u201d said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest. &#39;,
   &#39; Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOn behalf of the Muslim community in Davis, we would like to thank you for your contribution to help repair our Masjid,\u201d said Omar Awad, UC Davis Muslim Student Association president and Shifa Community Clinic volunteer, on the &#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis residents create financial model to make city\u2019s financial state more transparent&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;To increase transparency between the city\u2019s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. &#39;,
   u&#39;Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\u2019 Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cCity staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\u2019s potential financial position over the long term,\u201d Stachowicz said in an email interview. \u201cWe all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Project Toto complements the city\u2019s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\u2019s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.&#39;,
   u&#39;The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\u2019s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThis really isn\u2019t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\u201d Williams said in an interview with The &#39;,
   u&#39;. \u201cWhat happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. &#39;,
   &#39;The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said. \u201cYou can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\u2019s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. &#39;,
   &#39;There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s something I have been very much supportive of,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTransparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [\u2026] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\u201d&#39;],

   &#39;The fundraiser is a part of a project to continue caring for and restoring the historic community cemetery located at 820 Pole Line Road. &#39;,
   &#39;Ashley Wilson*, a Davis resident whose grandfather is buried at the cemetery, said that she thinks the fundraiser will welcome families to continue thinking of their loved ones and keep them from forgetting about them. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI like the idea of the fundraiser,\u201d Wilson said. \xa0\u201cI think it\u2019s a warm gesture. I know for me it reminds me of how much my grandfather liked to give us roses on Valentine\u2019s Day when I was younger.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Each flowerpot will cost $15 or loved ones can purchase two for $20. On Valentine\u2019s Day, staff will place the flowerpots on the gravesites. The flower arrangements themselves will follow the traditional color of Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 red. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cEach arrangement will feature vibrant Bellisima Red English daisy in a beautiful environmentally friendly four-inch Ecoform pot. These cheerful seasonal blooms will be a symbol of friendship and affection for those who cannot be with us during this season of love,\u201d said representatives of the Davis Cemetery in a &#39;,

They now have one of California\u2019s newest arboretums which features over 150 species of native and adapted plants in California. The plants are specifically suited to bear the climate of Yolo County. The cemetery also features Gallery 1855, an art gallery located on the grounds. &#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimer\u2019s patients at Yolo Hospice&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. &#39;,
   u&#39; have shown that patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.&#39;,
   &#39;In order to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe grant was wonderful and very generous,\u201d said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \u201cIt does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesn\u2019t affect patients\u2019 ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cYou figure out an individual\u2019s specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre,\u201d said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. \u201cIt\u2019s more about them connecting to their past in their music.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Although music isn\u2019t said to be a complete cure for Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, it does help \xa0bring some of the patients\u2019 memories back for the time being.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201c[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cMedication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life.\u201d &#39;,
   u&#39;The Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cAlive Inside\u201d is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music &amp; Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award. &#39;,
   &#39;There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional &#39;,
   &#39;, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods,\u201d said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. \u201cThese personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;Burrowing Owl Preservation Society sues City of Davis for improper assessment of environmental impact of Marriott hotel&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The Burrowing Owl Preservation Society (BOPS), which aims to educate the public and support conservation efforts for our feathered friends, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 5 against the City of Davis for its insufficient report on the environmental implications of the Marriott Residence Inn building site.&#39;,
   &#39;A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.&#39;,
   &#39;In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.&#39;,
   &#39;Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.&#39;,
   &#39;Janet Foley, a &#39;,
   &#39;professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\u201d Foley said. &#39;,
   &#39;\n&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.&#39;,
   u&#39;The complaint called into question the city council\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\u2019 leadership. The council\u2019s MND called for \u201cpassive relocation\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cPassive relocation\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\u201d&#39;],

   &#39;The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.&#39;,
   u&#39;According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\u201d \xa0&#39;,
   &#39;Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event,\u201d Davis said.&#39;,
   u&#39;A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. King\u2019s beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in today\u2019s political environment.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cToday\u2019s theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cFor, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, \u2018Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.\u2019\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic \u201cFreedom March\u201d through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march.&#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Local Whole Foods closes Feb. 12Written by: Kaelyn Tuermer-Lee \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.&#39;,
   u&#39;The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Food\u2019s locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joe\u2019s and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.&#39;,
   &#39;Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThat\u2019s why it closed down \u2013\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\u2019s, to grow.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI\u2019d love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s something that we critically need,\u201d said Mayor Robb Davis.&#39;,
   &#39;And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt just feels out of place, not having a Whole Foods in Davis,\u201d Pasturel said.&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Demonstrations take place at hundreds of Planned Parenthood locations nationwideWritten By: Anya Rehon \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthood\u2019s in-clinic abortion services. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for women\u2019s rights. &#39;,
   u&#39;Over 80 individuals RSVP\u2019d to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.&#39;,
   u&#39;This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as \u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood\u201d and \u201cnot your body, not your business.\u201d Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for women\u2019s health,\u201d said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. \u201cIt provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2014-2015 &#39;,
   u&#39;, of the \u201c9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. &#39;,
   &#39;Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cMy two daughters go to the clinic,\u201d Rodriquez said. \u201cTheir school is teaching them information about women\u2019s health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, \u201cHoly Mary, pray for our sinners.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;At UC Davis\u2019 Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are &#39;,
   &#39;.&#39;,
   &#39;Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance. &#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;California Redevelopment Agencies require Davis to sell Historic City HallWritten By: Bianca Antunez \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the &#39;,
   &#39;Davis Joint Unified School District&#39;,
   &#39; or Yolo County services. &#39;,
   &#39;California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the state\u2019s orders,\u201d said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. \u201cWe are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. &#39;,
   u&#39;Davis\u2019 Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cDavis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall,\u201d said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. \u201cLocated at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. &#39;,
   &#39;Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to &#39;,
   &#39;the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.&#39;,
   &#39;That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. &#39;,
   u&#39;While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the city\u2019s Historic Resource Management Commission.&#39;,
   u&#39;While there hasn\u2019t been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. &#39;,
   u&#39;Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the city\u2019s history. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWe have to demonstrate to the state that we are maximizing revenue from that sale,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt would be difficult for us to demonstrate that we are purchasing it at market [value] if we get it at a rate that we can potentially afford so we are unanimous in saying that it should be sold at market rate.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis residents show solidarity in wake of travel ban, vandalismWritten by: Caitlyn Sampley \u2014 city@theaggie.org&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.&#39;,
   &#39;Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the &#39;,
   u&#39;, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administration\u2019s list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.&#39;,
   u&#39;In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community,\u201d said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.&#39;,
   &#39;In the wake of a &#39;,
   u&#39; at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading \u201cwe support you.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cThere is no longer this predominating attitude that, \u2018well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion\u2019.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.&#39;,
   u&#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, \u201cUC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThere is still a lot of hateful sentiment,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cThis weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\u201d Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.&#39;,
   u&#39;On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with \u201cvery little changes.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cAfter you reach out, get involved,\u201d Mansuri said. \u201cAttend events, talks, panels, protests, and educate yourself. There is no shortage of people to talk to. Do not be shy. Be open minded and open hearted.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;CalRecycle donates $197,851&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units,\u201d said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. &#39;,
   &#39;With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOur parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\u201d Gilbert said. &#39;,
   &#39;To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. &#39;,
   &#39;In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. &#39;,
   &#39;Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. &#39;,
   &#39;According to the CalRecycle&#39;,
   u&#39;, \u201cDuring the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\u201d &#39;,
   &#39;Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. &#39;,
   &#39;Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIn the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\u201d said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.&#39;,
   u&#39;To help the campus reach its goal, Vang recommended that students make an effort to compost more \u2014 not just food, but napkins and other items as well. She\u2019s hoping that she can bring more composting collection services to the Coffee House later this spring. &#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;Mayor Robb Davis reaffirms that the City of Davis will not make any policy changes&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as \u201csanctuary jurisdictions.\u201d \u201cSanctuary jurisdiction\u201d is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies.&#39;,
   u&#39;The controversial executive order, titled \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\u201d was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.&#39;,
   &#39;The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city&#39;,
   &#39;, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&#39;,
   u&#39;Davis explained that the City of Davis\u2019 sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\u2019s [immigration] status in any interaction [\u2026] This is something that we\u2019ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\u2019re not fearful of contacting the police,\u201d Davis said. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;Davis believes that President Trump\u2019s executive order will make cities less safe.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cImagine if you\u2019re someone who is brought to this country, and you\u2019ve been trafficked and you\u2019re not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trump\u2019s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\u201d Davis said.&#39;,
   &#39;According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cOur police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\u2019re acting,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any concerns about the administration\u2019s threats [\u2026] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke&#39;,
   u&#39; We\u2019re not in a position where we\u2019re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\u2019 affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\u2019s the President of the United States. It\u2019s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \u2018no, we\u2019re not going to pass any of his bills\u2019 [\u2026] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\u201d Casas said.&#39;,
   u&#39;Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\u2019 stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cFor somebody to come around asking random questions like \u2018Hey, are you a citizen here?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of none of their business. If they\u2019re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\u2019t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\u2019m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [\u2026] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\u201d Angel-Gonzalez said.&#39;,
   &#39;Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis &#39;,
   &#39; by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&#39;,
   u&#39;The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\u2019s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\u2019s license without proof of legal residence. &#39;,
   &#39;The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.&#39;,
   u&#39;The legality of President Trump\u2019s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.&#39;],

  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism &#39;,
   &#39;, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. &#39;,
   u&#39;The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \u201cSoon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\u201d &#39;,
   u&#39;Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelho\u2019s arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. \xa0&#39;,
   &#39;The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cVideo footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle,\u201d said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.&#39;,
   u&#39;Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. \xa0&#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis residents create financial model to make city\u2019s financial state more transparent&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;To increase transparency between the city\u2019s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. &#39;,
   u&#39;Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\u2019 Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cCity staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\u2019s potential financial position over the long term,\u201d Stachowicz said in an email interview. \u201cWe all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Project Toto complements the city\u2019s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\u2019s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.&#39;,
   u&#39;The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\u2019s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThis really isn\u2019t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\u201d Williams said in an interview with The &#39;,
   u&#39;. \u201cWhat happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. &#39;,
   &#39;The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said. \u201cYou can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\u2019s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. &#39;,
   &#39;There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s something I have been very much supportive of,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTransparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [\u2026] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis Cemetery District hosts fundraiser with potted plantsWritten By: Dianna Rivera \u2014\xa0&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [u&#39;Who said that Valentine\u2019s Day is limited to young lovers? This Valentine\u2019s Day, the Davis Cemetery District will allow friends and family to place orders for potted plants to put on the graves of those who are buried there. &#39;,
   &#39;The fundraiser is a part of a project to continue caring for and restoring the historic community cemetery located at 820 Pole Line Road. &#39;,
   &#39;Ashley Wilson*, a Davis resident whose grandfather is buried at the cemetery, said that she thinks the fundraiser will welcome families to continue thinking of their loved ones and keep them from forgetting about them. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cI like the idea of the fundraiser,\u201d Wilson said. \xa0\u201cI think it\u2019s a warm gesture. I know for me it reminds me of how much my grandfather liked to give us roses on Valentine\u2019s Day when I was younger.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Each flowerpot will cost $15 or loved ones can purchase two for $20. On Valentine\u2019s Day, staff will place the flowerpots on the gravesites. The flower arrangements themselves will follow the traditional color of Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 red. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cEach arrangement will feature vibrant Bellisima Red English daisy in a beautiful environmentally friendly four-inch Ecoform pot. These cheerful seasonal blooms will be a symbol of friendship and affection for those who cannot be with us during this season of love,\u201d said representatives of the Davis Cemetery in a &#39;,
   &#39;.&#39;,
   u&#39;Since 1855, the Davis Cemetery District has provided a space to honor those who have passed. They now have one of California\u2019s newest arboretums which features over 150 species of native and adapted plants in California. The plants are specifically suited to bear the climate of Yolo County. The cemetery also features Gallery 1855, an art gallery located on the grounds. &#39;,
   &#39;According to the Davis Cemetery District and Arboretum &#39;,
   u&#39;, the art gallery is \u201cone of the finest premier art galleries in Northern California, featuring monthly shows by international, national, regional and local artists.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;This Valentine\u2019s Day, make it a goal to spend time not only with that special someone, friends, family or whomever it might be, but also to remember those who have passed. &#39;,

 {&#39;author&#39;: u&#39;Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimer\u2019s patients at Yolo Hospice&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. &#39;,
   u&#39; have shown that patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.&#39;,
   &#39;In order to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe grant was wonderful and very generous,\u201d said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \u201cIt does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesn\u2019t affect patients\u2019 ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cYou figure out an individual\u2019s specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre,\u201d said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. \u201cIt\u2019s more about them connecting to their past in their music.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Although music isn\u2019t said to be a complete cure for Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, it does help \xa0bring some of the patients\u2019 memories back for the time being.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201c[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cMedication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life.\u201d &#39;,
   u&#39;The Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cAlive Inside\u201d is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music &amp; Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award. &#39;,
   &#39;There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional &#39;,
   &#39;, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThe program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods,\u201d said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. \u201cThese personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories.\u201d&#39;],

 {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;Burrowing Owl Preservation Society sues City of Davis for improper assessment of environmental impact of Marriott hotel&#39;,
  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;The Burrowing Owl Preservation Society (BOPS), which aims to educate the public and support conservation efforts for our feathered friends, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 5 against the City of Davis for its insufficient report on the environmental implications of the Marriott Residence Inn building site.&#39;,
   &#39;A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.&#39;,
   &#39;In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.&#39;,
   &#39;Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.&#39;,
   &#39;Janet Foley, a &#39;,
   &#39;professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\u201d Foley said. &#39;,
   &#39;\n&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\u201d&#39;,
   &#39;Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.&#39;,
   u&#39;The complaint called into question the city council\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\u2019 leadership. The council\u2019s MND called for \u201cpassive relocation\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cPassive relocation\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. &#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\u201d&#39;],

  &#39;text&#39;: [&#39;On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. &#39;,
   &#39;The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.&#39;,
   u&#39;According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\u201d \xa0&#39;,
   &#39;Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event,\u201d Davis said.&#39;,
   u&#39;A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. \xa0&#39;,
   u&#39;In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. King\u2019s beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in today\u2019s political environment.&#39;,
   u&#39;\u201cToday\u2019s theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cFor, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, \u2018Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.\u2019\u201d&#39;,
   u&#39;Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic \u201cFreedom March\u201d through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march.&#39;,
   &#39;The event was recorded by the Davis Media Access and video can be found on its &#39;,

<pre>&#34;[u&#39;Current ASUCD Vice President Abhay Sandhu announced the ASUCD election results on Feb. 24 in the Memorial Union\\u2019s Mee room. Six senators were elected: Sam Chiang, Michael Gofman, Khadeja Ibrahim, Rahi Suryawanshi, Marcos Rodriguez and Yajaira Ramirez Sigala. Chiang and Ibrahim ran on the BASED slate, while Suryawanshi, Rodriguez and Ramirez Sigala ran on the Bespoke slate. Gofman ran independently.&#39;, &#39;The new ASUCD president and vice president will be Josh Dalavai and Adilla Jamaludin. Dalavai and Jamaludin ran on the BASED slate. &#39;, &#39;The results will also be posted online at elections.ucdavis.edu.&#39;][&#39;The University of California (UC) will retract a $300 million line of credit and a $150 million interest reset contract with Wells Fargo by April of this year. $200 million has already been retracted, and the remaining $100 million will be divested after a replacement bank is found. This follows the termination of the $25 million commercial paper contract with Wells Fargo by the UC in November of 2016. &#39;, &#39;In September of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo $100 million for secretly opening unauthorized banking accounts for existing customers. F&#39;, &#39;ederal investigators discovered that Wells Fargo employees had created &#39;, &#39; under the names of existing customers since 2011, prompting the California state treasury to suspend its Wells Fargo investment. The national bank was fined $185 million for these violations.&#39;, &#39; Wells Fargo is currently part of a banking conglomerate that provides a $900 million line of revolving credit to The GEO Group, the private prison and immigration detention company, and a $135 million line of credit to the private prison group CoreCivic. In August of 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed its intention to withdraw from privately-operated prison contracts. &#39;, &#39;Last year, the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC) successfully pushed the UC to divest $30 million from private prison companies.&#39;, u&#39;Wells Fargo has also faced accusations, lawsuits and settlements regarding racially discriminatory and predatory lending to African Americans and Latinos \\u2014 it &#39;, &#39; for $184.3 million in 2012. &#39;, &#39;Recently, Wells Fargo received negative press for helping fund the North Dakota Access Pipeline. &#39;, &#39;Wells Fargo is one of several large banks providing loans and support for the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. &#39;, &#39;Francisco Ferreyra, a third-year community and regional development major at UC Davis and the &#39;, &#39;environmental sustainability officer of the &#39;, &#39;UC Student Association, said that Davis residents and several student groups asked the Davis City Council to also take action against the Dakota Access Pipeline.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe came to the city council and we asked them to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock and oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline,\\u201d Ferreyra said. \\u201cThese oppressive forces of the fossil fuel industry, the finance industry, they don\\u2019t care about you or I. They care about two things: their profits and their reputations. The strategy for us on the ground is to hit them where it hurts, in those two spots. Divestment is a historically successful tactic.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;On Feb. 7, the City of Davis also &#39;, &#39;with Wells Fargo. It will be moving &#39;, u&#39;$124 million in banking services to another institution by the end of this year. Davis marks the second city embarking on this process, after Seattle finalized its divestment of $3 billion from \\xa0Wells Fargo on the same day.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOver the years, a couple of councils ago before I was on, there has been a desire to move more of our banking services to local or regional banks as opposed to large national banks that may or may not have real tight links to our community,\\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said.&#39;, u&#39;Davis believes that these unethical practices do not constitute socially responsible banking \\u2014 they are another factor in the council\\u2019s decision to divest.&#39;, u&#39;Claire Doan, a member of UC media relations, explained the university\\u2019s rationale for severing ties with Wells Fargo.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC believes unwinding some of our credit relationships and suspending our investment banking relationships in tandem with the state treasurer were appropriate actions taken in light of the unauthorized bank and credit card accounts opened by Wells Fargo,\\u201d Doan wrote via email. \\u201cHowever, we value our long-standing relationship with the bank, and moving forward we want to continue to engage with new leadership as they reform their business practices.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Connor Gorman, a UC student workers\\u2019 union organizer within the local Davis chapter, said that the ABC was \\u201cthe school\\u2019s driving force\\u201d in a push to divest from Wells Fargo. \\xa0&#39;, &#39;The ABC announced the divestment on its website and celebrated the victory.&#39;, u&#39; \\u201c&#39;, u&#39;By taking a stand against the amoral practices of an enormous corporation like Wells Fargo, the Afrikan Black Coalition is pushing the UC to exhibit the kind of leadership necessary for the survival of communities unfairly targeted by a criminal financial system,\\u201d a &#39;, u&#39; on the ABC website read. \\u201cWe dedicate this small victory to the hundreds and thousands of our people who are trapped in America\\u2019s gulags. Through the organized struggle of our masses, we believe our liberation is inevitable.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Ruben Pulido, the vice president and communications manager of corporate communications for Wells Fargo, wrote over email that the bank will continue to support the UC despite the divestment. Pulido said that Wells Fargo does not deny lines of credit with private prisons.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cSince the 1970\\u2019s, Wells Fargo has proudly supported the University of California\\u2019s mission to be a world-class public research university system,\\u201d Pulido said. \\u201cAnd we stand ready to provide that vital support in the future. While we respect the seriousness of our country\\u2019s ongoing debate about the criminal justice system, we do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our company\\u2019s ability to serve customers and support our team members. Due to chronic prison overcrowding, federal and state governments have for the past 30 years been contracting out detention services. People who want to change that should address their concerns with the appropriate government officials.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Pulido added that the bank wields no influence in private prison policies and conduct.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWells Fargo is a bank,\\u201d Pulido said. \\u201cWe do not set U.S. detention system policy; we have nothing to do with the setting or enforcement of laws; we don\\u2019t tell judges where to place people accused of or found guilty of violating the law; and we don\\u2019t tell the federal and state governments which companies should be awarded contracts. Wells Fargo holds no shares of either The GEO Group or CoreCivic. We have no seat on either company\\u2019s board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;In light of the recent executive order, universities across the country have organized similar rallies with the uniting objective of \\u201cAcademics United \\u2014 No Visa and Immigration Ban.\\u201d Nazanin Akrami and Ellie White \\u2014 both graduate students at UC Davis in cooperation with SEDAD, the Iranian graduate student association \\u2014 were the organizers of this peaceful rally.&#39;, &#39;The event was approximately an hour long, d&#39;, u&#39;uring which participants were prepared with rain ponchos, umbrellas and signs that displayed slogans such as \\u201cLove not hate makes the nation great\\u201d and \\u201cNo ban, No wall, No Trump, No fear.\\u201d It received publicity on multiple news platforms, including &#39;, &#39; and &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, u&#39;Akrami said that her goal for the event was \\u201cto start a conversation about diversity in order to feel more connected and help people going through these issues.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The rally showcased many speakers ranging from graduate students, to faculty members, to Mayor Robb Davis, whose speech was titled \\u201cMy Home Towns Are Home to the World.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;In his speech the mayor stressed the importance of \\u201cproclaiming ourselves a sanctuary city\\u201d and \\xa0\\u201cwelcoming people from all over the world.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThey have an order that capriciously excludes people from seven nations at the stroke of a pen, including the victims of wars that have grown in the soil where our nation soiled the seeds of societal destruction in the name of freedom,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cThis affects all of us because it fundamentally puts into question what feels real and natural and beautiful to us. It offends our cultural values.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Dr. Banafsheh Sadeghi, an assistant professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine, delivered an emotionally-charged speech about her personal experience with the executive order.&#39;, u&#39;Sadeghi discussed the fear of entering the unknown as a result of immigration, in addition to the psychological and emotional tolls of making sacrifices for \\u201cfollowing a path that leads to a better world.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Furthermore, she expressed the grief she felt when she was forced to choose between staying with her children in America or visiting her mother in her home country of Iran the week the executive order was put into effect. She went on to discuss how crucial it is to maintain \\u201clove and compassion\\u201d in such politically turbulent and tense times.&#39;, u&#39;Additionally, Koen Van Rompay, a recipient of the Chancellor\\u2019s Achievement Award for Diversity and Community, and Wesley Young, director of services for international students and scholars, both delivered talks on the priceless value of international ties.&#39;, &#39;Akrami and graduate students Hossein Karimi and Abdolhossein Edalati also shared stories of both triumph and struggle as a result of immigration and the consequences of the ban.&#39;, &#39;White read a statement on behalf of physics professor, Mohammad H. Hamidian, who was unable to be present at the rally.&#39;, u&#39;In his statement Hamidian recounted the story of his immigration to Canada as a war refugee during his childhood and later to the U.S. as a student. His statement expressed his concerns for the \\u201cfading opportunities of future immigrant professors, artists, musicians, engineers and teachers\\u201d and how they may not have the chance to \\u201cbe safe and reach their potential in a society with so many opportunities.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;On a lighter note, he concluded with having \\u201cimmense hope in the outpouring support and generosity of the people in this country.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;UC Davis Yassi Mostafavi, a second-year political science and English double major, and Ariana Abedifard, a second-year environmental policy analysis and planning major, both felt closely connected with the speeches given at the rally.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAs an Iranian, it\\u2019s heartwarming to see that people are coming out to support those affected by this terrible executive order, these are not the principles this country was founded on,\\u201d Mostafavi said.&#39;, u&#39;Abedifard said Sadeghi\\u2019s speech resonated with her in the sense that \\u201cyou have two homes, and it is hard to decide between the two and pick an identity, and things like [the immigration ban] make it even harder.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;Students have awaited the full reopening of the Memorial Union (MU) for almost two years since its closure in early 2015. Recently, however, the reopening date was pushed back to May 1, meaning that students will be left for an extra month without access to the central hub of campus.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe had been working towards a public opening that was slated to be April 3rd,\\u201d said Matt Fucile, the director of Building and Event Services, Divisional Resources, via email. \\u201cHowever, with some new information we have received on the construction processes, we are currently reviewing a postponement of that opening.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Notwithstanding another delay, plans are in motion to host a \\u201cceremonial grand opening.\\u201d Details remain scarce, however, on what this celebration will entail.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cA ceremonial grand opening will take place,\\u201d Fucile said. \\u201cPlanning for that is underway, and details should be more readily available shortly. Of course, while we had been close to the date for this, this will also need to be determined by the new opening date we are resolving. The plan was for the event not to happen on the opening date, but within a couple weeks after (schedule dependent).\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Greg Secor, senior project manager for Design and Construction Management, is one person who has been working on bringing the construction to completion. Secor is looking forward to students being able to see the MU fully renovated.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI will be excited to see the new wide open spaces created on the first [and] second floor of the MU,\\u201d Secor said via email. \\u201cThese new spaces are reminiscent of the building\\u2019s original design which had a clarity to its clear open floor plan. I think students will be excited about the large amount of new lounge space the building will provide. Hopefully it will take some pressure off the COHO right next door by providing more seating options for groups and individuals.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Sarah Santamaria, a second-year community and regional development major, is ready to experience the full MU for the first time, since it has been closed throughout her time at UC Davis so far.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI have heard a lot of talk about all of the different things that are going on and that are going to be brought, which I\\u2019ve never experienced,\\u201d Santamaria said. \\u201cI have heard a lot about the gaming area and that sounds really cool. Right now [\\u2026] the seating area, that sounds really nice. You\\u2019re always kind of having to run toward a seating area when it opens up. I think it\\u2019s just something that\\u2019s really exciting for our community here and something that makes us different and special and unique.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Looking back on the renovation process, Secor said that construction teams have faced various unexpected challenges while working on the building over the past two years. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAs with any remodel project on a building that is over 60 years old we expect to encounter some challenges,\\u201d Secor said. \\u201cOver the years this building has gone through several renovations that have significantly changed the building. As a result, we have found unexpected conditions when we started opening up walls. Some challenges included finding space for new duct work between the confined space of the existing floor structures and new ceilings or \\xa0discovering data and electrical lines in walls and ceilings where we didn\\u2019t expect them.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;Last month ASUCD President Alex Lee issued a series of vetoes on legislation passed by the student Senate, including a revision veto on a constitutional amendment to create a Judicial Council and a Judicial Council Oversight Committee (JCOC).&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;Constitutional Amendment #50, authored by the Internal Affairs Commission (IAC) chair Nick Flores, was passed on Jan. 26 with a vote of 9-1-1. Senator Sofia Molodanof voted against the measure while Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstained.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cASUCD Constitutional Amendment #49 was placed on the Fall 2016 ASUCD ballot and passed with an 86.49% affirmative vote, effectively dissolving the ASUCD Court,\\u201d Flores wrote in the amendment. \\u201cGiven the necessity for an adjudicating body in student government, this Amendment seeks to create a new, functioning Judicial Council in ASUCD. Additionally, this Amendment creates a Judicial Council Oversight Committee. This Committee, comprised of ASUCD officials from each branch of government, would maintain the power to either concur with or overrule the Judicial Council\\u2019s ruling.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;The JCOC, which would have the power to overturn decisions by the Judicial Court by a two-thirds majority, would have consisted of three voting members, the ASUCD vice president, the chair of the Judicial Council and the chair of the IAC. &#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;Lee\\u2019s revision of the amendment removed the proposition of the JCOC, saying that the Judicial Council should have final say on any ASUCD decision.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI am returning CA#50 with a veto and recommending deletion of JCOC because I believe an appellate jurisdiction for the appellate jurisdiction is redundant,\\u201d Lee said in a statement regarding his veto. \\u201cIf it is for this new Council to make judicial decisions under the Constitution, it does not make sense for another body to overturn their decisions. Especially as 2/3 of the JCOC are members of the Executive and Legislative Branches, who both historically have been opposed to judicial rulings.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;In an email interview, Lee described the unnecessary nature of having the final word be given to the branches who originally write the legislation before sending them to a judicial board.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAllowing members of the Legislative and Executive to overturn Judicial rulings as the last appellate power is not only redundant but defeats the very purpose of Judicial Review,\\u201d Lee said. \\u201cWhat is the point of having another branch to check the other two if the original two (who first saw the legislation [IAC] and later at the vote and signing [VP]) can just reinforce their original will? It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks. There definitely is an imbalance of power and renders the Judicial Council a useless piece of our already over-bloated ASUCD bureaucracy. If Judicial Council is to be created, it needs to be able to stand on its own two feet and not be rendered useless from the get go.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;Molodanof, who voted against the amendment, said that the significant inclusion of members from the other ASUCD branches in the JCOC did not create adequate representation for the student body.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cBasically, I didn\\u2019t agree with the JCOC portion of the bill, which is an appeals committee,\\u201d Molodanof said via email. \\u201cI wanted more student representation from the judicial board to be a part of the appeals team or to not have one at all. I didn\\u2019t like how other branches would have a say in appealing a vote by the judicial board (especially since the judicial board\\u2019s job is to act as a check). It didn\\u2019t really make sense to me that it could just be overturned by the majority of people from another ASUCD branch (exec and legislative).\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;Lee said that since the dissolution of ASUCD\\u2019s judicial branch in the fall of 2016, concerns have been expressed to the Senate and administration over the need for judicial review. Since the Senate did not convene on Feb. 16, in solidarity with A Day Without Immigrants, the amendment will not be up for a vote on the winter ballot. According to Lee, Flores has stated that he will urge the next president to call for a special election in an effort to create a new judicial branch.&#39;][&#39;Senate candidate Zaki Shaheen chose to publicly withdraw from the race during the ASUCD &#39;, &#39; on Feb. 21. After one of the debate moderators asked a question regarding one of his platforms, Shaheen spoke briefly about why students run for Senate and how he plans to become more involved with campus issues.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhy do people run for Senate?,\\u201d Shaheen said. \\u201cI think that that answer isn\\u2019t always very clear when you think about what you can also achieve as just an individual student in the process of learning more about ASUCD and about how this school works and preparing yourself to become a better candidate in the future and I just decided that that\\u2019s what I want to do. I\\u2019m going to withdraw myself, and I implore all of you to please pass your votes to these other candidates. I intend to spend the next several months learning more about ASUCD, learning more about this school, networking with people so hopefully I can become a candidate that you deserve better in the future. I love this school, I love all of its students, I love all of you and I hope to talk with you more. I\\u2019ll be around.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Shaheen then left the debate.&#39;, u&#39;According to ASUCD Elections Chair Sevan Nahabedian, Shaheen did not withdraw in time for his name to be removed from the ballot, but Shaheen\\u2019s votes will not be considered in the final count.&#39;, &#39;Students can currently vote online at elections.ucdavis.edu until Feb. 24 at 8 a.m.&#39;][u&#39;The UC Davis community recently received two crime alerts from the UC Davis Police Department (UCDPD) labelled as \\u201csuspicious circumstances vandalism/hate incident\\u201d and \\u201ccampus timely warning/hate incident.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;On Jan. 30, the letters \\u201cKKK\\u201d were found graffitied on the inside of a Memorial Union women\\u2019s bathroom stall in blue ink, six inches tall and 12 inches in length. School personnel removed the etching prior to the police arriving at the scene. &#39;, &#39;Later that week, a piece of pork tenderloin was left on the doorstep of Muslim students at 416 Russell Park between the dates of Feb. 3 and Feb. 5. &#39;, &#39;Sergeant Max Thomas of the UCDPD explained the Russell Park incident. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe people who live at the residence came home after being gone for a while and noticed that a piece of meat was lying out in front of their doorway,\\u201d Thomas said. \\u201cThe three residents happen to be Muslim. Their concern was that it may be referencing the incident at the mosque on Russell Boulevard. We\\u2019re still investigating \\u2014 what we\\u2019re finding out now is that it may have been done by an animal, because there may have been a nearby trash bag tore or scratched open.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The incident Thomas is referring to, the &#39;, u&#39; in which windows were broken, bikes were destroyed and pieces of bacon were laid on the mosque\\u2019s door handles, happened in the early hours of Jan. 22. In a university-wide email sent the following day, Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter stated that the crime has caused &#39;, &#39;fear and distress among Davis Muslim community members.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cActs and words of hatred directed toward Muslims as a group is an urgent and growing problem across our society,\\u201d Hexter said in the email. &#39;, &#39;The police department is still unsure if the two on campus incidents are related.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn this political climate, you tend to find a variety of different acts of vandalism,\\u201d Thomas said. \\u201cThese small acts can become bigger in these sensitive times, and people can react a lot stronger than they would normally.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Andy Fell, associate director of news and media relations at UC Davis, said that the UCDPD has not identified any suspects. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThere are no suspects for either incident,\\u201d Fell said. \\u201dThey are still being investigated.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Fell said that the theory of an animal dragging and dropping the pork tenderloin is a possibility, but that the investigation is still ensuing. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThat would be a benign explanation,\\u201d Fell said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not able to say anything conclusively at this point. The crime alert we sent out was classified as a hate incident based on the presence of pork outside Muslim students\\u2019 residence.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Dinar Kurji, a second-year religious studies major, believes that the Russell Park incident was targeted towards Muslims to intentionally disparage the community.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think that act was committed to humiliate a particular sect and to show disrespect,\\u201d Kurji said.\\u201dThey don\\u2019t understand that we didn\\u2019t consume it and that it is not unholy to touch or clean it up. It was done out of ignorance [and] hate and wasn\\u2019t a positive message.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;University of California (UC) President Janet Napolitano announced her selection of Gary May as the new UC Davis chancellor on Feb. 21. May currently serves as the dean of Georgia Tech\\u2019s College of Engineering. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cGary May is a dynamic leader and an accomplished scholar and engineer with a passion for helping others succeed,\\u201d Napolitano said in a &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cHe was chosen from an extraordinarily talented pool of candidates because I believe he\\u2019s the right person to guide UC Davis to even greater heights, advancing academic and research initiatives, building a stronger community with students, faculty, and staff, and furthering relations with the larger Davis and Sacramento areas.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;May will replace Ralph J. Hexter, who has been serving as interim chancellor since Napolitano put former Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi on &#39;, &#39; last April. Katehi &#39;, &#39; as chancellor in August. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI could not be more pleased, nor more excited, to serve as the next chancellor of the University of California at Davis,\\u201d May said in the same press release. \\u201cUC Davis is renowned for its excellent education and research, for providing its diverse student body with exceptional pathways for upward mobility and leadership, for giving its faculty opportunities for impactful discovery, and for serving the state and nation in areas of critical need. These values speak to my spirit, and I cannot wait to join the campus community.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The UC Board of Regents will meet on Feb. 23 to vote on the appointment, and, if approved, May will begin this role on August 1, becoming UC Davis\\u2019 seventh chancellor. In the meantime, Hexter will continue to serve as interim chancellor.&#39;][&#39;Due to new policies implemented after the &#39;, &#39; of former UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, University of California (UC) administrators are no longer seeking compensated board seats outside of their senior management jobs at the UC campuses.&#39;, &#39;In 2015, the UC reported that the majority of approved board positions had compensation, with a total of $1.57 million for 42 managers. After establishment of the new policies, however, the 2016 report noted that 11 managers were approved for their outside activities from July 21 to Nov. 30, only three of which were paid positions that totalled to $9,510 in compensation.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe new policy requires two levels of review and management approval,\\u201d a UC report read. \\u201cIn addition, more detailed reviews are conducted to assess real or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment, and reputational risk.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Activities now have to get approval through the campus chancellor, the president of the university or the chair of the Board of Regents. The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three. &#39;, u&#39;This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehi\\u2019s &#39;, &#39; last year, where she faced a series of controversies including &#39;, &#39; on two for-profit boards.&#39;, u&#39;Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and women\\u2019s studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators \\u201cinsurance\\u201d and hide their mistakes.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cKatehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so,\\u201d Fox said. \\u201cBy them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesn\\u2019t look bad for the UC as a whole. [\\u2026] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIf Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there aren\\u2019t conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cEverything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC,\\u201d Fox said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIf the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cTheir actions are more egregious.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cThis is something that\\u2019s in the public eye right now, so I don\\u2019t have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they won\\u2019t go straight back to their usual operation.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The UC Davis and UC Office of the President\\u2019s media relations did not respond to &#39;, u&#39;\\u2019s request for comments regarding the intentions of the new policies.&#39;][&#39;On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).&#39;, &#39;Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining.&#39;, &#39;As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agency\\u2019s statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project,\\u201d the notice read. \\u201cResponses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28.&#39;, &#39;ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students.&#39;, &#39;Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhat the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low,\\u201d Martinez said. \\u201cSo the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times can\\u2019t find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and it\\u2019s just, it\\u2019s not a good mix when it comes to housing.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018.&#39;, &#39;ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI definitely think that the issue of housing isn\\u2019t going away anytime soon,\\u201d Lee said. \\u201cThe issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, it\\u2019s going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of it\\u2019s population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasn\\u2019t always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and it\\u2019s not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding,\\u201d Martinez said. \\u201cSo I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they haven\\u2019t been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;The University of California\\u2019s 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25.

The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early.&#39;, &#39;Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [\\u2026] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year,\\u201d Kirk said via email.&#39;, &#39;Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cStudent activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero,\\u201d Knox said via email. \\u201cIn 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPreparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative,\\u201d Napolitano said in the report.&#39;, &#39;UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cHere at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere,\\u201d Knox said via email. \\u201cStudents can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects.&#39;, &#39;ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017.&#39;, &#39;UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, &#39;, &#39;which &#39;, &#39;they were supposed to stay under until 2020. &#39;, &#39;In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025.&#39;, &#39;More information regarding the &#39;, &#39;2016 Annual Report on Sustainability can be found on its &#39;, &#39;.

However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cRecent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values \\u2014 values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings,\\u201d Regulska said. \\u201cThree recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThese three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [\\u2026] attempt to destroy our community fabric,\\u201d Regulska said. \\u201cThey also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhy are so many who aren\\u2019t directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness?\\u201d Hexter asked the audience, according to &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cPart of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are \\u2014 and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, it\\u2019s difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trump\\u2019s executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law.&#39;, u&#39;Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students\\u2019 families as well.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students,\\u201d Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. \\u201cOur target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method \\u2014 they can contact us [\\u2026] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if you\\u2019re a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure,\\u201d Regulska said.&#39;, &#39;Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOn a personal note, as in immigrant to this country many years ago when I left communist Poland, it is especially painful to me to see state institutions adopting oppressive and authoritarian practices,\\u201d Regulska said.&#39;][&#39;President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.&#39;, u&#39;On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, \\u201cso long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled,\\u201d according to a &#39;, &#39; 60,000 visas were cancelled.&#39;, u&#39; \\u201cI am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas,\\u201d said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his &#39;, u&#39; to the campus community. \\u201cThis situation touches us closely.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThere seems to be some ambiguity as to whether I\\u2019d be allowed to return,\\u201d Hamidian said in an interview with &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City,\\u201d said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his &#39;, &#39; to the community. &#39;, &#39;He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.&#39;, u&#39; Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a master\\u2019s program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application.&#39;, &#39;On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives.&#39;, &#39;In an &#39;, &#39;, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201c&#39;, u&#39;There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldn\\u2019t attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home,\\u201d &#39;, &#39;said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering. &#39;, u&#39;An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now \\u201cthere is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The anonymous student also said that \\u201cthere are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPutting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now,\\u201d White said. \\u201cIran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [\\u2026] dealing with something similar. We\\u2019ve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships it\\u2019s causing, but it\\u2019s also having broader impacts.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhile maintaining the security of the nation\\u2019s visa system is critical, this executive order is contrary to the values we hold dear as leaders of the University of California,\\u201d read a &#39;, u&#39;, signed by the UC President and 10 Chancellors. \\u201cThe UC community, like universities across the country, has long been deeply enriched by students, faculty and scholars from around the world, including the affected countries, coming to study, teach and research.\\u201d \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;\\xa0&#39;][&#39;UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale &#39;, &#39;, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL. &#39;, u&#39;The students met at the Memorial Union \\xa0flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims. &#39;, u&#39;Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industry\\u2019s project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River,\\u201d Ferreyra said. \\u201cAnd if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The pipeline\\u2019s potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested.

Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities. &#39;, &#39;After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma. &#39;, &#39;The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change,\\u201d Ruttkay said via email.&#39;, u&#39;Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the university\\u2019s colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future. &#39;, &#39;Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences,\\u201d Olivan said. \\u201cIt definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as \\u201cnormal,\\u201d while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people. &#39;, &#39;Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means,\\u201d Olivan said. &#39;, &#39;Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended. &#39;, &#39;After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful,\\u201d Ruttkay said. &#39;, &#39;Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me,\\u201d Ruttkay said. \\u201cI was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego. &#39;, &#39;Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers. &#39;, &#39;The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadn\\u2019t anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times,\\u201d Chiang said via email.&#39;, &#39;Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference. &#39;, &#39;Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cA great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy,\\u201d Olivan said.&#39;, &#39;Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level,\\u201d Ruttkay said.&#39;, &#39;Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe\\u2019re looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health,\\u201d Grady said via email. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus.\\u201d &#39;][u&#39;Current ASUCD Vice President Abhay Sandhu announced the ASUCD election results on Feb. 24 in the Memorial Union\\u2019s Mee room. Six senators were elected: Sam Chiang, Michael Gofman, Khadeja Ibrahim, Rahi Suryawanshi, Marcos Rodriguez and Yajaira Ramirez Sigala. Chiang and Ibrahim ran on the BASED slate, while Suryawanshi, Rodriguez and Ramirez Sigala ran on the Bespoke slate. Gofman ran independently.&#39;, &#39;The new ASUCD president and vice president will be Josh Dalavai and Adilla Jamaludin.

This follows the termination of the $25 million commercial paper contract with Wells Fargo by the UC in November of 2016. &#39;, &#39;In September of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo $100 million for secretly opening unauthorized banking accounts for existing customers. F&#39;, &#39;ederal investigators discovered that Wells Fargo employees had created &#39;, &#39; under the names of existing customers since 2011, prompting the California state treasury to suspend its Wells Fargo investment. The national bank was fined $185 million for these violations.&#39;, &#39; Wells Fargo is currently part of a banking conglomerate that provides a $900 million line of revolving credit to The GEO Group, the private prison and immigration detention company, and a $135 million line of credit to the private prison group CoreCivic. In August of 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed its intention to withdraw from privately-operated prison contracts. &#39;, &#39;Last year, the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC) successfully pushed the UC to divest $30 million from private prison companies.&#39;, u&#39;Wells Fargo has also faced accusations, lawsuits and settlements regarding racially discriminatory and predatory lending to African Americans and Latinos \\u2014 it &#39;, &#39; for $184.3 million in 2012. &#39;, &#39;Recently, Wells Fargo received negative press for helping fund the North Dakota Access Pipeline. &#39;, &#39;Wells Fargo is one of several large banks providing loans and support for the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. &#39;, &#39;Francisco Ferreyra, a third-year community and regional development major at UC Davis and the &#39;, &#39;environmental sustainability officer of the &#39;, &#39;UC Student Association, said that Davis residents and several student groups asked the Davis City Council to also take action against the Dakota Access Pipeline.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe came to the city council and we asked them to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock and oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline,\\u201d Ferreyra said. \\u201cThese oppressive forces of the fossil fuel industry, the finance industry, they don\\u2019t care about you or I. They care about two things: their profits and their reputations. The strategy for us on the ground is to hit them where it hurts, in those two spots. Divestment is a historically successful tactic.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;On Feb. 7, the City of Davis also &#39;, &#39;with Wells Fargo. It will be moving &#39;, u&#39;$124 million in banking services to another institution by the end of this year. Davis marks the second city embarking on this process, after Seattle finalized its divestment of $3 billion from \\xa0Wells Fargo on the same day.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOver the years, a couple of councils ago before I was on, there has been a desire to move more of our banking services to local or regional banks as opposed to large national banks that may or may not have real tight links to our community,\\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said.&#39;, u&#39;Davis believes that these unethical practices do not constitute socially responsible banking \\u2014 they are another factor in the council\\u2019s decision to divest.&#39;, u&#39;Claire Doan, a member of UC media relations, explained the university\\u2019s rationale for severing ties with Wells Fargo.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC believes unwinding some of our credit relationships and suspending our investment banking relationships in tandem with the state treasurer were appropriate actions taken in light of the unauthorized bank and credit card accounts opened by Wells Fargo,\\u201d Doan wrote via email. \\u201cHowever, we value our long-standing relationship with the bank, and moving forward we want to continue to engage with new leadership as they reform their business practices.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Connor Gorman, a UC student workers\\u2019 union organizer within the local Davis chapter, said that the ABC was \\u201cthe school\\u2019s driving force\\u201d in a push to divest from Wells Fargo. \\xa0&#39;, &#39;The ABC announced the divestment on its website and celebrated the victory.&#39;, u&#39; \\u201c&#39;, u&#39;By taking a stand against the amoral practices of an enormous corporation like Wells Fargo, the Afrikan Black Coalition is pushing the UC to exhibit the kind of leadership necessary for the survival of communities unfairly targeted by a criminal financial system,\\u201d a &#39;, u&#39; on the ABC website read. \\u201cWe dedicate this small victory to the hundreds and thousands of our people who are trapped in America\\u2019s gulags. Through the organized struggle of our masses, we believe our liberation is inevitable.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Ruben Pulido, the vice president and communications manager of corporate communications for Wells Fargo, wrote over email that the bank will continue to support the UC despite the divestment. Pulido said that Wells Fargo does not deny lines of credit with private prisons.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cSince the 1970\\u2019s, Wells Fargo has proudly supported the University of California\\u2019s mission to be a world-class public research university system,\\u201d Pulido said. \\u201cAnd we stand ready to provide that vital support in the future. While we respect the seriousness of our country\\u2019s ongoing debate about the criminal justice system, we do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our company\\u2019s ability to serve customers and support our team members. Due to chronic prison overcrowding, federal and state governments have for the past 30 years been contracting out detention services. People who want to change that should address their concerns with the appropriate government officials.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Pulido added that the bank wields no influence in private prison policies and conduct.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWells Fargo is a bank,\\u201d Pulido said. \\u201cWe do not set U.S. detention system policy; we have nothing to do with the setting or enforcement of laws; we don\\u2019t tell judges where to place people accused of or found guilty of violating the law; and we don\\u2019t tell the federal and state governments which companies should be awarded contracts. Wells Fargo holds no shares of either The GEO Group or CoreCivic. We have no seat on either company\\u2019s board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;In light of the recent executive order, universities across the country have organized similar rallies with the uniting objective of \\u201cAcademics United \\u2014 No Visa and Immigration Ban.\\u201d Nazanin Akrami and Ellie White \\u2014 both graduate students at UC Davis in cooperation with SEDAD, the Iranian graduate student association \\u2014 were the organizers of this peaceful rally.&#39;, &#39;The event was approximately an hour long, d&#39;, u&#39;uring which participants were prepared with rain ponchos, umbrellas and signs that displayed slogans such as \\u201cLove not hate makes the nation great\\u201d and \\u201cNo ban, No wall, No Trump, No fear.\\u201d It received publicity on multiple news platforms, including &#39;, &#39; and &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, u&#39;Akrami said that her goal for the event was \\u201cto start a conversation about diversity in order to feel more connected and help people going through these issues.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The rally showcased many speakers ranging from graduate students, to faculty members, to Mayor Robb Davis, whose speech was titled \\u201cMy Home Towns Are Home to the World.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;In his speech the mayor stressed the importance of \\u201cproclaiming ourselves a sanctuary city\\u201d and \\xa0\\u201cwelcoming people from all over the world.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThey have an order that capriciously excludes people from seven nations at the stroke of a pen, including the victims of wars that have grown in the soil where our nation soiled the seeds of societal destruction in the name of freedom,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cThis affects all of us because it fundamentally puts into question what feels real and natural and beautiful to us. It offends our cultural values.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Dr. Banafsheh Sadeghi, an assistant professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine, delivered an emotionally-charged speech about her personal experience with the executive order.&#39;, u&#39;Sadeghi discussed the fear of entering the unknown as a result of immigration, in addition to the psychological and emotional tolls of making sacrifices for \\u201cfollowing a path that leads to a better world.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Furthermore, she expressed the grief she felt when she was forced to choose between staying with her children in America or visiting her mother in her home country of Iran the week the executive order was put into effect. She went on to discuss how crucial it is to maintain \\u201clove and compassion\\u201d in such politically turbulent and tense times.&#39;, u&#39;Additionally, Koen Van Rompay, a recipient of the Chancellor\\u2019s Achievement Award for Diversity and Community, and Wesley Young, director of services for international students and scholars, both delivered talks on the priceless value of international ties.&#39;, &#39;Akrami and graduate students Hossein Karimi and Abdolhossein Edalati also shared stories of both triumph and struggle as a result of immigration and the consequences of the ban.&#39;, &#39;White read a statement on behalf of physics professor, Mohammad H. Hamidian, who was unable to be present at the rally.&#39;, u&#39;In his statement Hamidian recounted the story of his immigration to Canada as a war refugee during his childhood and later to the U.S. as a student. His statement expressed his concerns for the \\u201cfading opportunities of future immigrant professors, artists, musicians, engineers and teachers\\u201d and how they may not have the chance to \\u201cbe safe and reach their potential in a society with so many opportunities.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;On a lighter note, he concluded with having \\u201cimmense hope in the outpouring support and generosity of the people in this country.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;UC Davis Yassi Mostafavi, a second-year political science and English double major, and Ariana Abedifard, a second-year environmental policy analysis and planning major, both felt closely connected with the speeches given at the rally.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAs an Iranian, it\\u2019s heartwarming to see that people are coming out to support those affected by this terrible executive order, these are not the principles this country was founded on,\\u201d Mostafavi said.&#39;, u&#39;Abedifard said Sadeghi\\u2019s speech resonated with her in the sense that \\u201cyou have two homes, and it is hard to decide between the two and pick an identity, and things like [the immigration ban] make it even harder.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;Students have awaited the full reopening of the Memorial Union (MU) for almost two years since its closure in early 2015. Recently, however, the reopening date was pushed back to May 1, meaning that students will be left for an extra month without access to the central hub of campus.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe had been working towards a public opening that was slated to be April 3rd,\\u201d said Matt Fucile, the director of Building and Event Services, Divisional Resources, via email. \\u201cHowever, with some new information we have received on the construction processes, we are currently reviewing a postponement of that opening.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Notwithstanding another delay, plans are in motion to host a \\u201cceremonial grand opening.\\u201d Details remain scarce, however, on what this celebration will entail.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cA ceremonial grand opening will take place,\\u201d Fucile said. \\u201cPlanning for that is underway, and details should be more readily available shortly. Of course, while we had been close to the date for this, this will also need to be determined by the new opening date we are resolving. The plan was for the event not to happen on the opening date, but within a couple weeks after (schedule dependent).\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Greg Secor, senior project manager for Design and Construction Management, is one person who has been working on bringing the construction to completion. Secor is looking forward to students being able to see the MU fully renovated.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI will be excited to see the new wide open spaces created on the first [and] second floor of the MU,\\u201d Secor said via email. \\u201cThese new spaces are reminiscent of the building\\u2019s original design which had a clarity to its clear open floor plan. I think students will be excited about the large amount of new lounge space the building will provide. Hopefully it will take some pressure off the COHO right next door by providing more seating options for groups and individuals.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Sarah Santamaria, a second-year community and regional development major, is ready to experience the full MU for the first time, since it has been closed throughout her time at UC Davis so far.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI have heard a lot of talk about all of the different things that are going on and that are going to be brought, which I\\u2019ve never experienced,\\u201d Santamaria said. \\u201cI have heard a lot about the gaming area and that sounds really cool. Right now [\\u2026] the seating area, that sounds really nice. You\\u2019re always kind of having to run toward a seating area when it opens up. I think it\\u2019s just something that\\u2019s really exciting for our community here and something that makes us different and special and unique.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Looking back on the renovation process, Secor said that construction teams have faced various unexpected challenges while working on the building over the past two years. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAs with any remodel project on a building that is over 60 years old we expect to encounter some challenges,\\u201d Secor said. \\u201cOver the years this building has gone through several renovations that have significantly changed the building. As a result, we have found unexpected conditions when we started opening up walls. Some challenges included finding space for new duct work between the confined space of the existing floor structures and new ceilings or \\xa0discovering data and electrical lines in walls and ceilings where we didn\\u2019t expect them.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;Last month ASUCD President Alex Lee issued a series of vetoes on legislation passed by the student Senate, including a revision veto on a constitutional amendment to create a Judicial Council and a Judicial Council Oversight Committee (JCOC).&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;Constitutional Amendment #50, authored by the Internal Affairs Commission (IAC) chair Nick Flores, was passed on Jan. 26 with a vote of 9-1-1. Senator Sofia Molodanof voted against the measure while Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstained.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cASUCD Constitutional Amendment #49 was placed on the Fall 2016 ASUCD ballot and passed with an 86.49% affirmative vote, effectively dissolving the ASUCD Court,\\u201d Flores wrote in the amendment. \\u201cGiven the necessity for an adjudicating body in student government, this Amendment seeks to create a new, functioning Judicial Council in ASUCD. Additionally, this Amendment creates a Judicial Council Oversight Committee. This Committee, comprised of ASUCD officials from each branch of government, would maintain the power to either concur with or overrule the Judicial Council\\u2019s ruling.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;The JCOC, which would have the power to overturn decisions by the Judicial Court by a two-thirds majority, would have consisted of three voting members, the ASUCD vice president, the chair of the Judicial Council and the chair of the IAC. &#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;Lee\\u2019s revision of the amendment removed the proposition of the JCOC, saying that the Judicial Council should have final say on any ASUCD decision.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI am returning CA#50 with a veto and recommending deletion of JCOC because I believe an appellate jurisdiction for the appellate jurisdiction is redundant,\\u201d Lee said in a statement regarding his veto. \\u201cIf it is for this new Council to make judicial decisions under the Constitution, it does not make sense for another body to overturn their decisions. Especially as 2/3 of the JCOC are members of the Executive and Legislative Branches, who both historically have been opposed to judicial rulings.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;In an email interview, Lee described the unnecessary nature of having the final word be given to the branches who originally write the legislation before sending them to a judicial board.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAllowing members of the Legislative and Executive to overturn Judicial rulings as the last appellate power is not only redundant but defeats the very purpose of Judicial Review,\\u201d Lee said. \\u201cWhat is the point of having another branch to check the other two if the original two (who first saw the legislation [IAC] and later at the vote and signing [VP]) can just reinforce their original will? It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks. There definitely is an imbalance of power and renders the Judicial Council a useless piece of our already over-bloated ASUCD bureaucracy. If Judicial Council is to be created, it needs to be able to stand on its own two feet and not be rendered useless from the get go.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;Molodanof, who voted against the amendment, said that the significant inclusion of members from the other ASUCD branches in the JCOC did not create adequate representation for the student body.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cBasically, I didn\\u2019t agree with the JCOC portion of the bill, which is an appeals committee,\\u201d Molodanof said via email. \\u201cI wanted more student representation from the judicial board to be a part of the appeals team or to not have one at all. I didn\\u2019t like how other branches would have a say in appealing a vote by the judicial board (especially since the judicial board\\u2019s job is to act as a check). It didn\\u2019t really make sense to me that it could just be overturned by the majority of people from another ASUCD branch (exec and legislative).\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;Lee said that since the dissolution of ASUCD\\u2019s judicial branch in the fall of 2016, concerns have been expressed to the Senate and administration over the need for judicial review. Since the Senate did not convene on Feb. 16, in solidarity with A Day Without Immigrants, the amendment will not be up for a vote on the winter ballot. According to Lee, Flores has stated that he will urge the next president to call for a special election in an effort to create a new judicial branch.&#39;][&#39;Senate candidate Zaki Shaheen chose to publicly withdraw from the race during the ASUCD &#39;, &#39; on Feb. 21. After one of the debate moderators asked a question regarding one of his platforms, Shaheen spoke briefly about why students run for Senate and how he plans to become more involved with campus issues.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhy do people run for Senate?,\\u201d Shaheen said. \\u201cI think that that answer isn\\u2019t always very clear when you think about what you can also achieve as just an individual student in the process of learning more about ASUCD and about how this school works and preparing yourself to become a better candidate in the future and I just decided that that\\u2019s what I want to do. I\\u2019m going to withdraw myself, and I implore all of you to please pass your votes to these other candidates. I intend to spend the next several months learning more about ASUCD, learning more about this school, networking with people so hopefully I can become a candidate that you deserve better in the future. I love this school, I love all of its students, I love all of you and I hope to talk with you more. I\\u2019ll be around.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Shaheen then left the debate.&#39;, u&#39;According to ASUCD Elections Chair Sevan Nahabedian, Shaheen did not withdraw in time for his name to be removed from the ballot, but Shaheen\\u2019s votes will not be considered in the final count.&#39;, &#39;Students can currently vote online at elections.ucdavis.edu until Feb. 24 at 8 a.m.&#39;][u&#39;The UC Davis community recently received two crime alerts from the UC Davis Police Department (UCDPD) labelled as \\u201csuspicious circumstances vandalism/hate incident\\u201d and \\u201ccampus timely warning/hate incident.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;On Jan. 30, the letters \\u201cKKK\\u201d were found graffitied on the inside of a Memorial Union women\\u2019s bathroom stall in blue ink, six inches tall and 12 inches in length. School personnel removed the etching prior to the police arriving at the scene. &#39;, &#39;Later that week, a piece of pork tenderloin was left on the doorstep of Muslim students at 416 Russell Park between the dates of Feb. 3 and Feb. 5. &#39;, &#39;Sergeant Max Thomas of the UCDPD explained the Russell Park incident. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe people who live at the residence came home after being gone for a while and noticed that a piece of meat was lying out in front of their doorway,\\u201d Thomas said. \\u201cThe three residents happen to be Muslim. Their concern was that it may be referencing the incident at the mosque on Russell Boulevard. We\\u2019re still investigating \\u2014 what we\\u2019re finding out now is that it may have been done by an animal, because there may have been a nearby trash bag tore or scratched open.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The incident Thomas is referring to, the &#39;, u&#39; in which windows were broken, bikes were destroyed and pieces of bacon were laid on the mosque\\u2019s door handles, happened in the early hours of Jan. 22.

May currently serves as the dean of Georgia Tech\\u2019s College of Engineering. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cGary May is a dynamic leader and an accomplished scholar and engineer with a passion for helping others succeed,\\u201d Napolitano said in a &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cHe was chosen from an extraordinarily talented pool of candidates because I believe he\\u2019s the right person to guide UC Davis to even greater heights, advancing academic and research initiatives, building a stronger community with students, faculty, and staff, and furthering relations with the larger Davis and Sacramento areas.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;May will replace Ralph J. Hexter, who has been serving as interim chancellor since Napolitano put former Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi on &#39;, &#39; last April. Katehi &#39;, &#39; as chancellor in August. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI could not be more pleased, nor more excited, to serve as the next chancellor of the University of California at Davis,\\u201d May said in the same press release. \\u201cUC Davis is renowned for its excellent education and research, for providing its diverse student body with exceptional pathways for upward mobility and leadership, for giving its faculty opportunities for impactful discovery, and for serving the state and nation in areas of critical need. These values speak to my spirit, and I cannot wait to join the campus community.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The UC Board of Regents will meet on Feb. 23 to vote on the appointment, and, if approved, May will begin this role on August 1, becoming UC Davis\\u2019 seventh chancellor. In the meantime, Hexter will continue to serve as interim chancellor.&#39;][&#39;Due to new policies implemented after the &#39;, &#39; of former UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, University of California (UC) administrators are no longer seeking compensated board seats outside of their senior management jobs at the UC campuses.&#39;, &#39;In 2015, the UC reported that the majority of approved board positions had compensation, with a total of $1.57 million for 42 managers. After establishment of the new policies, however, the 2016 report noted that 11 managers were approved for their outside activities from July 21 to Nov. 30, only three of which were paid positions that totalled to $9,510 in compensation.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe new policy requires two levels of review and management approval,\\u201d a UC report read. \\u201cIn addition, more detailed reviews are conducted to assess real or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment, and reputational risk.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Activities now have to get approval through the campus chancellor, the president of the university or the chair of the Board of Regents. The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three. &#39;, u&#39;This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehi\\u2019s &#39;, &#39; last year, where she faced a series of controversies including &#39;, &#39; on two for-profit boards.&#39;, u&#39;Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and women\\u2019s studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators \\u201cinsurance\\u201d and hide their mistakes.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cKatehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so,\\u201d Fox said. \\u201cBy them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesn\\u2019t look bad for the UC as a whole. [\\u2026] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIf Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there aren\\u2019t conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cEverything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC,\\u201d Fox said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIf the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cTheir actions are more egregious.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cThis is something that\\u2019s in the public eye right now, so I don\\u2019t have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they won\\u2019t go straight back to their usual operation.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The UC Davis and UC Office of the President\\u2019s media relations did not respond to &#39;, u&#39;\\u2019s request for comments regarding the intentions of the new policies.&#39;][&#39;On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).&#39;, &#39;Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining.&#39;, &#39;As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agency\\u2019s statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project,\\u201d the notice read. \\u201cResponses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28.&#39;, &#39;ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students.&#39;, &#39;Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhat the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low,\\u201d Martinez said. \\u201cSo the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times can\\u2019t find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and it\\u2019s just, it\\u2019s not a good mix when it comes to housing.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018.&#39;, &#39;ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI definitely think that the issue of housing isn\\u2019t going away anytime soon,\\u201d Lee said. \\u201cThe issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, it\\u2019s going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of it\\u2019s population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasn\\u2019t always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and it\\u2019s not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding,\\u201d Martinez said. \\u201cSo I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they haven\\u2019t been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;The University of California\\u2019s 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25. The 2016 report relays both the UC\\u2019s successes and challenges ahead in regards to renewable energy, water conservation, waste reduction, food sustainability and UC-wide sustainability goals.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe\\u2019re attacking this challenge on multiple fronts \\u2014 undertaking basic and applied research, teaching, changing the way we operate, investing in climate change solutions and being a model of positive change,\\u201d said UC President Janet Napolitano in the report.&#39;, u&#39;The report highlights UC Davis\\u2019 implementation of its 16.3 MW large solar power plant, the largest known on any university campus, which generates approximately 33 million kilowatt hours for the campus and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 14,000 metric tons annually.&#39;, &#39;UC Davis has been consistently meeting or approaching UC-wide sustainability goals. The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early.&#39;, &#39;Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [\\u2026] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year,\\u201d Kirk said via email.&#39;, &#39;Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cStudent activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero,\\u201d Knox said via email. \\u201cIn 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPreparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative,\\u201d Napolitano said in the report.&#39;, &#39;UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cHere at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere,\\u201d Knox said via email. \\u201cStudents can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects.&#39;, &#39;ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017.&#39;, &#39;UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, &#39;, &#39;which &#39;, &#39;they were supposed to stay under until 2020. &#39;, &#39;In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025.&#39;, &#39;More information regarding the &#39;, &#39;2016 Annual Report on Sustainability can be found on its &#39;, &#39;. Interested individuals can also look at a sustainability &#39;, &#39; of UC Davis.&#39;][u&#39;In a packed main lobby of the UC Davis International Center, UC Davis Global Affairs hosted a discussion on Feb. 2 concerning President Donald Trump\\u2019s executive orders on immigration. &#39;, &#39;This order, one of the more infamous of the ones President Trump has signed thus far, bans travel of persons from seven Muslim-majority nations. However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cRecent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values \\u2014 values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings,\\u201d Regulska said. \\u201cThree recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThese three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [\\u2026] attempt to destroy our community fabric,\\u201d Regulska said. \\u201cThey also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhy are so many who aren\\u2019t directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness?\\u201d Hexter asked the audience, according to &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cPart of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are \\u2014 and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, it\\u2019s difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trump\\u2019s executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law.&#39;, u&#39;Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students\\u2019 families as well.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students,\\u201d Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. \\u201cOur target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method \\u2014 they can contact us [\\u2026] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if you\\u2019re a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure,\\u201d Regulska said.&#39;, &#39;Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOn a personal note, as in immigrant to this country many years ago when I left communist Poland, it is especially painful to me to see state institutions adopting oppressive and authoritarian practices,\\u201d Regulska said.&#39;][&#39;President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.&#39;, u&#39;On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, \\u201cso long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled,\\u201d according to a &#39;, &#39; 60,000 visas were cancelled.&#39;, u&#39; \\u201cI am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas,\\u201d said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his &#39;, u&#39; to the campus community. \\u201cThis situation touches us closely.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThere seems to be some ambiguity as to whether I\\u2019d be allowed to return,\\u201d Hamidian said in an interview with &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City,\\u201d said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his &#39;, &#39; to the community. &#39;, &#39;He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.&#39;, u&#39; Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a master\\u2019s program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application.&#39;, &#39;On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives.&#39;, &#39;In an &#39;, &#39;, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201c&#39;, u&#39;There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldn\\u2019t attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home,\\u201d &#39;, &#39;said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering. &#39;, u&#39;An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now \\u201cthere is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The anonymous student also said that \\u201cthere are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPutting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now,\\u201d White said. \\u201cIran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [\\u2026] dealing with something similar. We\\u2019ve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships it\\u2019s causing, but it\\u2019s also having broader impacts.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhile maintaining the security of the nation\\u2019s visa system is critical, this executive order is contrary to the values we hold dear as leaders of the University of California,\\u201d read a &#39;, u&#39;, signed by the UC President and 10 Chancellors. \\u201cThe UC community, like universities across the country, has long been deeply enriched by students, faculty and scholars from around the world, including the affected countries, coming to study, teach and research.\\u201d \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;\\xa0&#39;][&#39;UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale &#39;, &#39;, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL. &#39;, u&#39;The students met at the Memorial Union \\xa0flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims. &#39;, u&#39;Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industry\\u2019s project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River,\\u201d Ferreyra said. \\u201cAnd if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The pipeline\\u2019s potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested. Last month, it was &#39;, &#39; that the University of California Retirement Plan, managed by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents, currently holds bonds in Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t make sense for one of the leading climate science institutions in America to invest in an industry that is killing the earth,\\u201d said Hanna Presiado, a first-year environmental science and management major. &#39;, &#39;With President Donald &#39;, u&#39; advancing the approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, as he promised during his campaign, some students feel that the current administration\\u2019s stance on environmental policy does not reflect the will of the people and will be detrimental for future generations. &#39;, u&#39;Josh Wertheim, a third-year anthropology major who participated in the protests at Standing Rock in North Dakota, expressed his concern for the environment and the pipeline\\u2019s impact on future generations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis is our world and we borrow the world from the future,\\u201d Wertheim said.&#39;, &#39; The &#39;, &#39; as Secretary of State has also riled supporters of environmental sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cTrump\\u2019s corporate colonial cabinet is hard at work ensuring that students like us will have no planet to enact our education onto,\\u201d Ferrerya said. \\u201cClimate denialism kills, and the fact that our Secretary of State is a former CEO of the largest oil company in the world is a sobering reminder that the climate catastrophe will only get worse unless the people can successfully step in.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;UC Davis held its first mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday Feb. 7. Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities. &#39;, &#39;After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma. &#39;, &#39;The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change,\\u201d Ruttkay said via email.&#39;, u&#39;Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the university\\u2019s colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future. &#39;, &#39;Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences,\\u201d Olivan said. \\u201cIt definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as \\u201cnormal,\\u201d while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people. &#39;, &#39;Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means,\\u201d Olivan said. &#39;, &#39;Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended. &#39;, &#39;After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful,\\u201d Ruttkay said. &#39;, &#39;Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me,\\u201d Ruttkay said. \\u201cI was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego. &#39;, &#39;Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers. &#39;, &#39;The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadn\\u2019t anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times,\\u201d Chiang said via email.&#39;, &#39;Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference. &#39;, &#39;Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cA great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy,\\u201d Olivan said.&#39;, &#39;Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level,\\u201d Ruttkay said.&#39;, &#39;Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe\\u2019re looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health,\\u201d Grady said via email. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus.\\u201d &#39;][u&#39;Current ASUCD Vice President Abhay Sandhu announced the ASUCD election results on Feb. 24 in the Memorial Union\\u2019s Mee room.

This follows the termination of the $25 million commercial paper contract with Wells Fargo by the UC in November of 2016. &#39;, &#39;In September of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo $100 million for secretly opening unauthorized banking accounts for existing customers. F&#39;, &#39;ederal investigators discovered that Wells Fargo employees had created &#39;, &#39; under the names of existing customers since 2011, prompting the California state treasury to suspend its Wells Fargo investment. The national bank was fined $185 million for these violations.&#39;, &#39; Wells Fargo is currently part of a banking conglomerate that provides a $900 million line of revolving credit to The GEO Group, the private prison and immigration detention company, and a $135 million line of credit to the private prison group CoreCivic. In August of 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed its intention to withdraw from privately-operated prison contracts. &#39;, &#39;Last year, the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC) successfully pushed the UC to divest $30 million from private prison companies.&#39;, u&#39;Wells Fargo has also faced accusations, lawsuits and settlements regarding racially discriminatory and predatory lending to African Americans and Latinos \\u2014 it &#39;, &#39; for $184.3 million in 2012. &#39;, &#39;Recently, Wells Fargo received negative press for helping fund the North Dakota Access Pipeline. &#39;, &#39;Wells Fargo is one of several large banks providing loans and support for the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. &#39;, &#39;Francisco Ferreyra, a third-year community and regional development major at UC Davis and the &#39;, &#39;environmental sustainability officer of the &#39;, &#39;UC Student Association, said that Davis residents and several student groups asked the Davis City Council to also take action against the Dakota Access Pipeline.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe came to the city council and we asked them to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock and oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline,\\u201d Ferreyra said. \\u201cThese oppressive forces of the fossil fuel industry, the finance industry, they don\\u2019t care about you or I. They care about two things: their profits and their reputations. The strategy for us on the ground is to hit them where it hurts, in those two spots. Divestment is a historically successful tactic.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;On Feb. 7, the City of Davis also &#39;, &#39;with Wells Fargo. It will be moving &#39;, u&#39;$124 million in banking services to another institution by the end of this year. Davis marks the second city embarking on this process, after Seattle finalized its divestment of $3 billion from \\xa0Wells Fargo on the same day.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOver the years, a couple of councils ago before I was on, there has been a desire to move more of our banking services to local or regional banks as opposed to large national banks that may or may not have real tight links to our community,\\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said.&#39;, u&#39;Davis believes that these unethical practices do not constitute socially responsible banking \\u2014 they are another factor in the council\\u2019s decision to divest.&#39;, u&#39;Claire Doan, a member of UC media relations, explained the university\\u2019s rationale for severing ties with Wells Fargo.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC believes unwinding some of our credit relationships and suspending our investment banking relationships in tandem with the state treasurer were appropriate actions taken in light of the unauthorized bank and credit card accounts opened by Wells Fargo,\\u201d Doan wrote via email. \\u201cHowever, we value our long-standing relationship with the bank, and moving forward we want to continue to engage with new leadership as they reform their business practices.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Connor Gorman, a UC student workers\\u2019 union organizer within the local Davis chapter, said that the ABC was \\u201cthe school\\u2019s driving force\\u201d in a push to divest from Wells Fargo. \\xa0&#39;, &#39;The ABC announced the divestment on its website and celebrated the victory.&#39;, u&#39; \\u201c&#39;, u&#39;By taking a stand against the amoral practices of an enormous corporation like Wells Fargo, the Afrikan Black Coalition is pushing the UC to exhibit the kind of leadership necessary for the survival of communities unfairly targeted by a criminal financial system,\\u201d a &#39;, u&#39; on the ABC website read. \\u201cWe dedicate this small victory to the hundreds and thousands of our people who are trapped in America\\u2019s gulags. Through the organized struggle of our masses, we believe our liberation is inevitable.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Ruben Pulido, the vice president and communications manager of corporate communications for Wells Fargo, wrote over email that the bank will continue to support the UC despite the divestment. Pulido said that Wells Fargo does not deny lines of credit with private prisons.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cSince the 1970\\u2019s, Wells Fargo has proudly supported the University of California\\u2019s mission to be a world-class public research university system,\\u201d Pulido said. \\u201cAnd we stand ready to provide that vital support in the future. While we respect the seriousness of our country\\u2019s ongoing debate about the criminal justice system, we do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our company\\u2019s ability to serve customers and support our team members. Due to chronic prison overcrowding, federal and state governments have for the past 30 years been contracting out detention services. People who want to change that should address their concerns with the appropriate government officials.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Pulido added that the bank wields no influence in private prison policies and conduct.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWells Fargo is a bank,\\u201d Pulido said. \\u201cWe do not set U.S. detention system policy; we have nothing to do with the setting or enforcement of laws; we don\\u2019t tell judges where to place people accused of or found guilty of violating the law; and we don\\u2019t tell the federal and state governments which companies should be awarded contracts. Wells Fargo holds no shares of either The GEO Group or CoreCivic. We have no seat on either company\\u2019s board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;In light of the recent executive order, universities across the country have organized similar rallies with the uniting objective of \\u201cAcademics United \\u2014 No Visa and Immigration Ban.\\u201d Nazanin Akrami and Ellie White \\u2014 both graduate students at UC Davis in cooperation with SEDAD, the Iranian graduate student association \\u2014 were the organizers of this peaceful rally.&#39;, &#39;The event was approximately an hour long, d&#39;, u&#39;uring which participants were prepared with rain ponchos, umbrellas and signs that displayed slogans such as \\u201cLove not hate makes the nation great\\u201d and \\u201cNo ban, No wall, No Trump, No fear.\\u201d It received publicity on multiple news platforms, including &#39;, &#39; and &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, u&#39;Akrami said that her goal for the event was \\u201cto start a conversation about diversity in order to feel more connected and help people going through these issues.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The rally showcased many speakers ranging from graduate students, to faculty members, to Mayor Robb Davis, whose speech was titled \\u201cMy Home Towns Are Home to the World.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;In his speech the mayor stressed the importance of \\u201cproclaiming ourselves a sanctuary city\\u201d and \\xa0\\u201cwelcoming people from all over the world.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThey have an order that capriciously excludes people from seven nations at the stroke of a pen, including the victims of wars that have grown in the soil where our nation soiled the seeds of societal destruction in the name of freedom,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cThis affects all of us because it fundamentally puts into question what feels real and natural and beautiful to us. It offends our cultural values.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Dr. Banafsheh Sadeghi, an assistant professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine, delivered an emotionally-charged speech about her personal experience with the executive order.&#39;, u&#39;Sadeghi discussed the fear of entering the unknown as a result of immigration, in addition to the psychological and emotional tolls of making sacrifices for \\u201cfollowing a path that leads to a better world.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Furthermore, she expressed the grief she felt when she was forced to choose between staying with her children in America or visiting her mother in her home country of Iran the week the executive order was put into effect. She went on to discuss how crucial it is to maintain \\u201clove and compassion\\u201d in such politically turbulent and tense times.&#39;, u&#39;Additionally, Koen Van Rompay, a recipient of the Chancellor\\u2019s Achievement Award for Diversity and Community, and Wesley Young, director of services for international students and scholars, both delivered talks on the priceless value of international ties.&#39;, &#39;Akrami and graduate students Hossein Karimi and Abdolhossein Edalati also shared stories of both triumph and struggle as a result of immigration and the consequences of the ban.&#39;, &#39;White read a statement on behalf of physics professor, Mohammad H. Hamidian, who was unable to be present at the rally.&#39;, u&#39;In his statement Hamidian recounted the story of his immigration to Canada as a war refugee during his childhood and later to the U.S. as a student. His statement expressed his concerns for the \\u201cfading opportunities of future immigrant professors, artists, musicians, engineers and teachers\\u201d and how they may not have the chance to \\u201cbe safe and reach their potential in a society with so many opportunities.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;On a lighter note, he concluded with having \\u201cimmense hope in the outpouring support and generosity of the people in this country.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;UC Davis Yassi Mostafavi, a second-year political science and English double major, and Ariana Abedifard, a second-year environmental policy analysis and planning major, both felt closely connected with the speeches given at the rally.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAs an Iranian, it\\u2019s heartwarming to see that people are coming out to support those affected by this terrible executive order, these are not the principles this country was founded on,\\u201d Mostafavi said.&#39;, u&#39;Abedifard said Sadeghi\\u2019s speech resonated with her in the sense that \\u201cyou have two homes, and it is hard to decide between the two and pick an identity, and things like [the immigration ban] make it even harder.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;Students have awaited the full reopening of the Memorial Union (MU) for almost two years since its closure in early 2015. Recently, however, the reopening date was pushed back to May 1, meaning that students will be left for an extra month without access to the central hub of campus.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe had been working towards a public opening that was slated to be April 3rd,\\u201d said Matt Fucile, the director of Building and Event Services, Divisional Resources, via email. \\u201cHowever, with some new information we have received on the construction processes, we are currently reviewing a postponement of that opening.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Notwithstanding another delay, plans are in motion to host a \\u201cceremonial grand opening.\\u201d Details remain scarce, however, on what this celebration will entail.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cA ceremonial grand opening will take place,\\u201d Fucile said. \\u201cPlanning for that is underway, and details should be more readily available shortly. Of course, while we had been close to the date for this, this will also need to be determined by the new opening date we are resolving. The plan was for the event not to happen on the opening date, but within a couple weeks after (schedule dependent).\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Greg Secor, senior project manager for Design and Construction Management, is one person who has been working on bringing the construction to completion. Secor is looking forward to students being able to see the MU fully renovated.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI will be excited to see the new wide open spaces created on the first [and] second floor of the MU,\\u201d Secor said via email. \\u201cThese new spaces are reminiscent of the building\\u2019s original design which had a clarity to its clear open floor plan. I think students will be excited about the large amount of new lounge space the building will provide. Hopefully it will take some pressure off the COHO right next door by providing more seating options for groups and individuals.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Sarah Santamaria, a second-year community and regional development major, is ready to experience the full MU for the first time, since it has been closed throughout her time at UC Davis so far.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI have heard a lot of talk about all of the different things that are going on and that are going to be brought, which I\\u2019ve never experienced,\\u201d Santamaria said. \\u201cI have heard a lot about the gaming area and that sounds really cool. Right now [\\u2026] the seating area, that sounds really nice. You\\u2019re always kind of having to run toward a seating area when it opens up. I think it\\u2019s just something that\\u2019s really exciting for our community here and something that makes us different and special and unique.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Looking back on the renovation process, Secor said that construction teams have faced various unexpected challenges while working on the building over the past two years. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAs with any remodel project on a building that is over 60 years old we expect to encounter some challenges,\\u201d Secor said. \\u201cOver the years this building has gone through several renovations that have significantly changed the building. As a result, we have found unexpected conditions when we started opening up walls. Some challenges included finding space for new duct work between the confined space of the existing floor structures and new ceilings or \\xa0discovering data and electrical lines in walls and ceilings where we didn\\u2019t expect them.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;Last month ASUCD President Alex Lee issued a series of vetoes on legislation passed by the student Senate, including a revision veto on a constitutional amendment to create a Judicial Council and a Judicial Council Oversight Committee (JCOC).&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;Constitutional Amendment #50, authored by the Internal Affairs Commission (IAC) chair Nick Flores, was passed on Jan. 26 with a vote of 9-1-1. Senator Sofia Molodanof voted against the measure while Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstained.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cASUCD Constitutional Amendment #49 was placed on the Fall 2016 ASUCD ballot and passed with an 86.49% affirmative vote, effectively dissolving the ASUCD Court,\\u201d Flores wrote in the amendment. \\u201cGiven the necessity for an adjudicating body in student government, this Amendment seeks to create a new, functioning Judicial Council in ASUCD. Additionally, this Amendment creates a Judicial Council Oversight Committee. This Committee, comprised of ASUCD officials from each branch of government, would maintain the power to either concur with or overrule the Judicial Council\\u2019s ruling.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;The JCOC, which would have the power to overturn decisions by the Judicial Court by a two-thirds majority, would have consisted of three voting members, the ASUCD vice president, the chair of the Judicial Council and the chair of the IAC. &#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;Lee\\u2019s revision of the amendment removed the proposition of the JCOC, saying that the Judicial Council should have final say on any ASUCD decision.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI am returning CA#50 with a veto and recommending deletion of JCOC because I believe an appellate jurisdiction for the appellate jurisdiction is redundant,\\u201d Lee said in a statement regarding his veto. \\u201cIf it is for this new Council to make judicial decisions under the Constitution, it does not make sense for another body to overturn their decisions. Especially as 2/3 of the JCOC are members of the Executive and Legislative Branches, who both historically have been opposed to judicial rulings.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;In an email interview, Lee described the unnecessary nature of having the final word be given to the branches who originally write the legislation before sending them to a judicial board.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAllowing members of the Legislative and Executive to overturn Judicial rulings as the last appellate power is not only redundant but defeats the very purpose of Judicial Review,\\u201d Lee said. \\u201cWhat is the point of having another branch to check the other two if the original two (who first saw the legislation [IAC] and later at the vote and signing [VP]) can just reinforce their original will? It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks. There definitely is an imbalance of power and renders the Judicial Council a useless piece of our already over-bloated ASUCD bureaucracy. If Judicial Council is to be created, it needs to be able to stand on its own two feet and not be rendered useless from the get go.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;Molodanof, who voted against the amendment, said that the significant inclusion of members from the other ASUCD branches in the JCOC did not create adequate representation for the student body.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cBasically, I didn\\u2019t agree with the JCOC portion of the bill, which is an appeals committee,\\u201d Molodanof said via email. \\u201cI wanted more student representation from the judicial board to be a part of the appeals team or to not have one at all. I didn\\u2019t like how other branches would have a say in appealing a vote by the judicial board (especially since the judicial board\\u2019s job is to act as a check). It didn\\u2019t really make sense to me that it could just be overturned by the majority of people from another ASUCD branch (exec and legislative).\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;Lee said that since the dissolution of ASUCD\\u2019s judicial branch in the fall of 2016, concerns have been expressed to the Senate and administration over the need for judicial review. Since the Senate did not convene on Feb. 16, in solidarity with A Day Without Immigrants, the amendment will not be up for a vote on the winter ballot. According to Lee, Flores has stated that he will urge the next president to call for a special election in an effort to create a new judicial branch.&#39;][&#39;Senate candidate Zaki Shaheen chose to publicly withdraw from the race during the ASUCD &#39;, &#39; on Feb. 21. After one of the debate moderators asked a question regarding one of his platforms, Shaheen spoke briefly about why students run for Senate and how he plans to become more involved with campus issues.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhy do people run for Senate?,\\u201d Shaheen said. \\u201cI think that that answer isn\\u2019t always very clear when you think about what you can also achieve as just an individual student in the process of learning more about ASUCD and about how this school works and preparing yourself to become a better candidate in the future and I just decided that that\\u2019s what I want to do. I\\u2019m going to withdraw myself, and I implore all of you to please pass your votes to these other candidates. I intend to spend the next several months learning more about ASUCD, learning more about this school, networking with people so hopefully I can become a candidate that you deserve better in the future.

School personnel removed the etching prior to the police arriving at the scene. &#39;, &#39;Later that week, a piece of pork tenderloin was left on the doorstep of Muslim students at 416 Russell Park between the dates of Feb. 3 and Feb. 5. &#39;, &#39;Sergeant Max Thomas of the UCDPD explained the Russell Park incident. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe people who live at the residence came home after being gone for a while and noticed that a piece of meat was lying out in front of their doorway,\\u201d Thomas said. \\u201cThe three residents happen to be Muslim. Their concern was that it may be referencing the incident at the mosque on Russell Boulevard.

Katehi &#39;, &#39; as chancellor in August. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI could not be more pleased, nor more excited, to serve as the next chancellor of the University of California at Davis,\\u201d May said in the same press release. \\u201cUC Davis is renowned for its excellent education and research, for providing its diverse student body with exceptional pathways for upward mobility and leadership, for giving its faculty opportunities for impactful discovery, and for serving the state and nation in areas of critical need. These values speak to my spirit, and I cannot wait to join the campus community.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The UC Board of Regents will meet on Feb. 23 to vote on the appointment, and, if approved, May will begin this role on August 1, becoming UC Davis\\u2019 seventh chancellor. In the meantime, Hexter will continue to serve as interim chancellor.&#39;][&#39;Due to new policies implemented after the &#39;, &#39; of former UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, University of California (UC) administrators are no longer seeking compensated board seats outside of their senior management jobs at the UC campuses.&#39;, &#39;In 2015, the UC reported that the majority of approved board positions had compensation, with a total of $1.57 million for 42 managers. After establishment of the new policies, however, the 2016 report noted that 11 managers were approved for their outside activities from July 21 to Nov. 30, only three of which were paid positions that totalled to $9,510 in compensation.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe new policy requires two levels of review and management approval,\\u201d a UC report read. \\u201cIn addition, more detailed reviews are conducted to assess real or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment, and reputational risk.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Activities now have to get approval through the campus chancellor, the president of the university or the chair of the Board of Regents. The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three. &#39;, u&#39;This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehi\\u2019s &#39;, &#39; last year, where she faced a series of controversies including &#39;, &#39; on two for-profit boards.&#39;, u&#39;Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and women\\u2019s studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators \\u201cinsurance\\u201d and hide their mistakes.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cKatehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so,\\u201d Fox said. \\u201cBy them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesn\\u2019t look bad for the UC as a whole. [\\u2026] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIf Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there aren\\u2019t conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cEverything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC,\\u201d Fox said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIf the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cTheir actions are more egregious.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cThis is something that\\u2019s in the public eye right now, so I don\\u2019t have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they won\\u2019t go straight back to their usual operation.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The UC Davis and UC Office of the President\\u2019s media relations did not respond to &#39;, u&#39;\\u2019s request for comments regarding the intentions of the new policies.&#39;][&#39;On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).&#39;, &#39;Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining.&#39;, &#39;As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agency\\u2019s statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project,\\u201d the notice read. \\u201cResponses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28.&#39;, &#39;ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students.&#39;, &#39;Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhat the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low,\\u201d Martinez said. \\u201cSo the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times can\\u2019t find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and it\\u2019s just, it\\u2019s not a good mix when it comes to housing.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018.&#39;, &#39;ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI definitely think that the issue of housing isn\\u2019t going away anytime soon,\\u201d Lee said. \\u201cThe issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, it\\u2019s going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of it\\u2019s population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasn\\u2019t always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and it\\u2019s not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding,\\u201d Martinez said. \\u201cSo I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they haven\\u2019t been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;The University of California\\u2019s 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25. The 2016 report relays both the UC\\u2019s successes and challenges ahead in regards to renewable energy, water conservation, waste reduction, food sustainability and UC-wide sustainability goals.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe\\u2019re attacking this challenge on multiple fronts \\u2014 undertaking basic and applied research, teaching, changing the way we operate, investing in climate change solutions and being a model of positive change,\\u201d said UC President Janet Napolitano in the report.&#39;, u&#39;The report highlights UC Davis\\u2019 implementation of its 16.3 MW large solar power plant, the largest known on any university campus, which generates approximately 33 million kilowatt hours for the campus and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 14,000 metric tons annually.&#39;, &#39;UC Davis has been consistently meeting or approaching UC-wide sustainability goals. The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early.&#39;, &#39;Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [\\u2026] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year,\\u201d Kirk said via email.&#39;, &#39;Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cStudent activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero,\\u201d Knox said via email. \\u201cIn 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPreparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative,\\u201d Napolitano said in the report.&#39;, &#39;UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cHere at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere,\\u201d Knox said via email. \\u201cStudents can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects.&#39;, &#39;ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017.&#39;, &#39;UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, &#39;, &#39;which &#39;, &#39;they were supposed to stay under until 2020. &#39;, &#39;In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025.&#39;, &#39;More information regarding the &#39;, &#39;2016 Annual Report on Sustainability can be found on its &#39;, &#39;. Interested individuals can also look at a sustainability &#39;, &#39; of UC Davis.&#39;][u&#39;In a packed main lobby of the UC Davis International Center, UC Davis Global Affairs hosted a discussion on Feb. 2 concerning President Donald Trump\\u2019s executive orders on immigration. &#39;, &#39;This order, one of the more infamous of the ones President Trump has signed thus far, bans travel of persons from seven Muslim-majority nations. However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cRecent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values \\u2014 values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings,\\u201d Regulska said. \\u201cThree recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThese three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [\\u2026] attempt to destroy our community fabric,\\u201d Regulska said. \\u201cThey also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhy are so many who aren\\u2019t directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness?\\u201d Hexter asked the audience, according to &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cPart of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are \\u2014 and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, it\\u2019s difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trump\\u2019s executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law.&#39;, u&#39;Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students\\u2019 families as well.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students,\\u201d Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. \\u201cOur target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method \\u2014 they can contact us [\\u2026] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if you\\u2019re a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure,\\u201d Regulska said.&#39;, &#39;Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOn a personal note, as in immigrant to this country many years ago when I left communist Poland, it is especially painful to me to see state institutions adopting oppressive and authoritarian practices,\\u201d Regulska said.&#39;][&#39;President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.&#39;, u&#39;On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, \\u201cso long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled,\\u201d according to a &#39;, &#39; 60,000 visas were cancelled.&#39;, u&#39; \\u201cI am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas,\\u201d said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his &#39;, u&#39; to the campus community. \\u201cThis situation touches us closely.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThere seems to be some ambiguity as to whether I\\u2019d be allowed to return,\\u201d Hamidian said in an interview with &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City,\\u201d said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his &#39;, &#39; to the community. &#39;, &#39;He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.&#39;, u&#39; Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a master\\u2019s program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application.&#39;, &#39;On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives.&#39;, &#39;In an &#39;, &#39;, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201c&#39;, u&#39;There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldn\\u2019t attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home,\\u201d &#39;, &#39;said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering. &#39;, u&#39;An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now \\u201cthere is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The anonymous student also said that \\u201cthere are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPutting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now,\\u201d White said. \\u201cIran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [\\u2026] dealing with something similar. We\\u2019ve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships it\\u2019s causing, but it\\u2019s also having broader impacts.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhile maintaining the security of the nation\\u2019s visa system is critical, this executive order is contrary to the values we hold dear as leaders of the University of California,\\u201d read a &#39;, u&#39;, signed by the UC President and 10 Chancellors. \\u201cThe UC community, like universities across the country, has long been deeply enriched by students, faculty and scholars from around the world, including the affected countries, coming to study, teach and research.\\u201d \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;\\xa0&#39;][&#39;UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale &#39;, &#39;, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL. &#39;, u&#39;The students met at the Memorial Union \\xa0flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims. &#39;, u&#39;Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industry\\u2019s project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River,\\u201d Ferreyra said. \\u201cAnd if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The pipeline\\u2019s potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested. Last month, it was &#39;, &#39; that the University of California Retirement Plan, managed by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents, currently holds bonds in Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t make sense for one of the leading climate science institutions in America to invest in an industry that is killing the earth,\\u201d said Hanna Presiado, a first-year environmental science and management major. &#39;, &#39;With President Donald &#39;, u&#39; advancing the approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, as he promised during his campaign, some students feel that the current administration\\u2019s stance on environmental policy does not reflect the will of the people and will be detrimental for future generations. &#39;, u&#39;Josh Wertheim, a third-year anthropology major who participated in the protests at Standing Rock in North Dakota, expressed his concern for the environment and the pipeline\\u2019s impact on future generations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis is our world and we borrow the world from the future,\\u201d Wertheim said.&#39;, &#39; The &#39;, &#39; as Secretary of State has also riled supporters of environmental sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cTrump\\u2019s corporate colonial cabinet is hard at work ensuring that students like us will have no planet to enact our education onto,\\u201d Ferrerya said. \\u201cClimate denialism kills, and the fact that our Secretary of State is a former CEO of the largest oil company in the world is a sobering reminder that the climate catastrophe will only get worse unless the people can successfully step in.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;UC Davis held its first mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday Feb. 7. Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities. &#39;, &#39;After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma. &#39;, &#39;The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change,\\u201d Ruttkay said via email.&#39;, u&#39;Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the university\\u2019s colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future. &#39;, &#39;Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences,\\u201d Olivan said. \\u201cIt definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as \\u201cnormal,\\u201d while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people. &#39;, &#39;Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means,\\u201d Olivan said. &#39;, &#39;Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended. &#39;, &#39;After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful,\\u201d Ruttkay said. &#39;, &#39;Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me,\\u201d Ruttkay said. \\u201cI was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego. &#39;, &#39;Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers. &#39;, &#39;The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadn\\u2019t anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times,\\u201d Chiang said via email.&#39;, &#39;Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference. &#39;, &#39;Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cA great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy,\\u201d Olivan said.&#39;, &#39;Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level,\\u201d Ruttkay said.&#39;, &#39;Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe\\u2019re looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health,\\u201d Grady said via email. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus.\\u201d &#39;][u&#39;Current ASUCD Vice President Abhay Sandhu announced the ASUCD election results on Feb. 24 in the Memorial Union\\u2019s Mee room.

This follows the termination of the $25 million commercial paper contract with Wells Fargo by the UC in November of 2016. &#39;, &#39;In September of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo $100 million for secretly opening unauthorized banking accounts for existing customers. F&#39;, &#39;ederal investigators discovered that Wells Fargo employees had created &#39;, &#39; under the names of existing customers since 2011, prompting the California state treasury to suspend its Wells Fargo investment. The national bank was fined $185 million for these violations.&#39;, &#39; Wells Fargo is currently part of a banking conglomerate that provides a $900 million line of revolving credit to The GEO Group, the private prison and immigration detention company, and a $135 million line of credit to the private prison group CoreCivic. In August of 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed its intention to withdraw from privately-operated prison contracts. &#39;, &#39;Last year, the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC) successfully pushed the UC to divest $30 million from private prison companies.&#39;, u&#39;Wells Fargo has also faced accusations, lawsuits and settlements regarding racially discriminatory and predatory lending to African Americans and Latinos \\u2014 it &#39;, &#39; for $184.3 million in 2012. &#39;, &#39;Recently, Wells Fargo received negative press for helping fund the North Dakota Access Pipeline. &#39;, &#39;Wells Fargo is one of several large banks providing loans and support for the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. &#39;, &#39;Francisco Ferreyra, a third-year community and regional development major at UC Davis and the &#39;, &#39;environmental sustainability officer of the &#39;, &#39;UC Student Association, said that Davis residents and several student groups asked the Davis City Council to also take action against the Dakota Access Pipeline.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe came to the city council and we asked them to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock and oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline,\\u201d Ferreyra said. \\u201cThese oppressive forces of the fossil fuel industry, the finance industry, they don\\u2019t care about you or I. They care about two things: their profits and their reputations. The strategy for us on the ground is to hit them where it hurts, in those two spots.

It will be moving &#39;, u&#39;$124 million in banking services to another institution by the end of this year. Davis marks the second city embarking on this process, after Seattle finalized its divestment of $3 billion from \\xa0Wells Fargo on the same day.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOver the years, a couple of councils ago before I was on, there has been a desire to move more of our banking services to local or regional banks as opposed to large national banks that may or may not have real tight links to our community,\\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said.&#39;, u&#39;Davis believes that these unethical practices do not constitute socially responsible banking \\u2014 they are another factor in the council\\u2019s decision to divest.&#39;, u&#39;Claire Doan, a member of UC media relations, explained the university\\u2019s rationale for severing ties with Wells Fargo.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC believes unwinding some of our credit relationships and suspending our investment banking relationships in tandem with the state treasurer were appropriate actions taken in light of the unauthorized bank and credit card accounts opened by Wells Fargo,\\u201d Doan wrote via email. \\u201cHowever, we value our long-standing relationship with the bank, and moving forward we want to continue to engage with new leadership as they reform their business practices.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Connor Gorman, a UC student workers\\u2019 union organizer within the local Davis chapter, said that the ABC was \\u201cthe school\\u2019s driving force\\u201d in a push to divest from Wells Fargo. \\xa0&#39;, &#39;The ABC announced the divestment on its website and celebrated the victory.&#39;, u&#39; \\u201c&#39;, u&#39;By taking a stand against the amoral practices of an enormous corporation like Wells Fargo, the Afrikan Black Coalition is pushing the UC to exhibit the kind of leadership necessary for the survival of communities unfairly targeted by a criminal financial system,\\u201d a &#39;, u&#39; on the ABC website read. \\u201cWe dedicate this small victory to the hundreds and thousands of our people who are trapped in America\\u2019s gulags. Through the organized struggle of our masses, we believe our liberation is inevitable.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Ruben Pulido, the vice president and communications manager of corporate communications for Wells Fargo, wrote over email that the bank will continue to support the UC despite the divestment. Pulido said that Wells Fargo does not deny lines of credit with private prisons.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cSince the 1970\\u2019s, Wells Fargo has proudly supported the University of California\\u2019s mission to be a world-class public research university system,\\u201d Pulido said. \\u201cAnd we stand ready to provide that vital support in the future. While we respect the seriousness of our country\\u2019s ongoing debate about the criminal justice system, we do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our company\\u2019s ability to serve customers and support our team members. Due to chronic prison overcrowding, federal and state governments have for the past 30 years been contracting out detention services. People who want to change that should address their concerns with the appropriate government officials.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Pulido added that the bank wields no influence in private prison policies and conduct.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWells Fargo is a bank,\\u201d Pulido said. \\u201cWe do not set U.S. detention system policy; we have nothing to do with the setting or enforcement of laws; we don\\u2019t tell judges where to place people accused of or found guilty of violating the law; and we don\\u2019t tell the federal and state governments which companies should be awarded contracts. Wells Fargo holds no shares of either The GEO Group or CoreCivic.

It offends our cultural values.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Dr. Banafsheh Sadeghi, an assistant professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine, delivered an emotionally-charged speech about her personal experience with the executive order.&#39;, u&#39;Sadeghi discussed the fear of entering the unknown as a result of immigration, in addition to the psychological and emotional tolls of making sacrifices for \\u201cfollowing a path that leads to a better world.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Furthermore, she expressed the grief she felt when she was forced to choose between staying with her children in America or visiting her mother in her home country of Iran the week the executive order was put into effect. She went on to discuss how crucial it is to maintain \\u201clove and compassion\\u201d in such politically turbulent and tense times.&#39;, u&#39;Additionally, Koen Van Rompay, a recipient of the Chancellor\\u2019s Achievement Award for Diversity and Community, and Wesley Young, director of services for international students and scholars, both delivered talks on the priceless value of international ties.&#39;, &#39;Akrami and graduate students Hossein Karimi and Abdolhossein Edalati also shared stories of both triumph and struggle as a result of immigration and the consequences of the ban.&#39;, &#39;White read a statement on behalf of physics professor, Mohammad H. Hamidian, who was unable to be present at the rally.&#39;, u&#39;In his statement Hamidian recounted the story of his immigration to Canada as a war refugee during his childhood and later to the U.S. as a student.

Recently, however, the reopening date was pushed back to May 1, meaning that students will be left for an extra month without access to the central hub of campus.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe had been working towards a public opening that was slated to be April 3rd,\\u201d said Matt Fucile, the director of Building and Event Services, Divisional Resources, via email. \\u201cHowever, with some new information we have received on the construction processes, we are currently reviewing a postponement of that opening.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Notwithstanding another delay, plans are in motion to host a \\u201cceremonial grand opening.\\u201d Details remain scarce, however, on what this celebration will entail.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cA ceremonial grand opening will take place,\\u201d Fucile said. \\u201cPlanning for that is underway, and details should be more readily available shortly. Of course, while we had been close to the date for this, this will also need to be determined by the new opening date we are resolving. The plan was for the event not to happen on the opening date, but within a couple weeks after (schedule dependent).\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Greg Secor, senior project manager for Design and Construction Management, is one person who has been working on bringing the construction to completion. Secor is looking forward to students being able to see the MU fully renovated.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI will be excited to see the new wide open spaces created on the first [and] second floor of the MU,\\u201d Secor said via email. \\u201cThese new spaces are reminiscent of the building\\u2019s original design which had a clarity to its clear open floor plan. I think students will be excited about the large amount of new lounge space the building will provide. Hopefully it will take some pressure off the COHO right next door by providing more seating options for groups and individuals.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Sarah Santamaria, a second-year community and regional development major, is ready to experience the full MU for the first time, since it has been closed throughout her time at UC Davis so far.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI have heard a lot of talk about all of the different things that are going on and that are going to be brought, which I\\u2019ve never experienced,\\u201d Santamaria said. \\u201cI have heard a lot about the gaming area and that sounds really cool. Right now [\\u2026] the seating area, that sounds really nice. You\\u2019re always kind of having to run toward a seating area when it opens up. I think it\\u2019s just something that\\u2019s really exciting for our community here and something that makes us different and special and unique.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Looking back on the renovation process, Secor said that construction teams have faced various unexpected challenges while working on the building over the past two years. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAs with any remodel project on a building that is over 60 years old we expect to encounter some challenges,\\u201d Secor said. \\u201cOver the years this building has gone through several renovations that have significantly changed the building. As a result, we have found unexpected conditions when we started opening up walls. Some challenges included finding space for new duct work between the confined space of the existing floor structures and new ceilings or \\xa0discovering data and electrical lines in walls and ceilings where we didn\\u2019t expect them.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;Last month ASUCD President Alex Lee issued a series of vetoes on legislation passed by the student Senate, including a revision veto on a constitutional amendment to create a Judicial Council and a Judicial Council Oversight Committee (JCOC).&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;Constitutional Amendment #50, authored by the Internal Affairs Commission (IAC) chair Nick Flores, was passed on Jan. 26 with a vote of 9-1-1. Senator Sofia Molodanof voted against the measure while Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstained.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cASUCD Constitutional Amendment #49 was placed on the Fall 2016 ASUCD ballot and passed with an 86.49% affirmative vote, effectively dissolving the ASUCD Court,\\u201d Flores wrote in the amendment. \\u201cGiven the necessity for an adjudicating body in student government, this Amendment seeks to create a new, functioning Judicial Council in ASUCD. Additionally, this Amendment creates a Judicial Council Oversight Committee. This Committee, comprised of ASUCD officials from each branch of government, would maintain the power to either concur with or overrule the Judicial Council\\u2019s ruling.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;The JCOC, which would have the power to overturn decisions by the Judicial Court by a two-thirds majority, would have consisted of three voting members, the ASUCD vice president, the chair of the Judicial Council and the chair of the IAC. &#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;Lee\\u2019s revision of the amendment removed the proposition of the JCOC, saying that the Judicial Council should have final say on any ASUCD decision.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI am returning CA#50 with a veto and recommending deletion of JCOC because I believe an appellate jurisdiction for the appellate jurisdiction is redundant,\\u201d Lee said in a statement regarding his veto. \\u201cIf it is for this new Council to make judicial decisions under the Constitution, it does not make sense for another body to overturn their decisions. Especially as 2/3 of the JCOC are members of the Executive and Legislative Branches, who both historically have been opposed to judicial rulings.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;In an email interview, Lee described the unnecessary nature of having the final word be given to the branches who originally write the legislation before sending them to a judicial board.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAllowing members of the Legislative and Executive to overturn Judicial rulings as the last appellate power is not only redundant but defeats the very purpose of Judicial Review,\\u201d Lee said. \\u201cWhat is the point of having another branch to check the other two if the original two (who first saw the legislation [IAC] and later at the vote and signing [VP]) can just reinforce their original will? It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks. There definitely is an imbalance of power and renders the Judicial Council a useless piece of our already over-bloated ASUCD bureaucracy. If Judicial Council is to be created, it needs to be able to stand on its own two feet and not be rendered useless from the get go.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;Molodanof, who voted against the amendment, said that the significant inclusion of members from the other ASUCD branches in the JCOC did not create adequate representation for the student body.&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cBasically, I didn\\u2019t agree with the JCOC portion of the bill, which is an appeals committee,\\u201d Molodanof said via email. \\u201cI wanted more student representation from the judicial board to be a part of the appeals team or to not have one at all. I didn\\u2019t like how other branches would have a say in appealing a vote by the judicial board (especially since the judicial board\\u2019s job is to act as a check). It didn\\u2019t really make sense to me that it could just be overturned by the majority of people from another ASUCD branch (exec and legislative).\\u201d&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;Lee said that since the dissolution of ASUCD\\u2019s judicial branch in the fall of 2016, concerns have been expressed to the Senate and administration over the need for judicial review. Since the Senate did not convene on Feb. 16, in solidarity with A Day Without Immigrants, the amendment will not be up for a vote on the winter ballot. According to Lee, Flores has stated that he will urge the next president to call for a special election in an effort to create a new judicial branch.&#39;][&#39;Senate candidate Zaki Shaheen chose to publicly withdraw from the race during the ASUCD &#39;, &#39; on Feb. 21. After one of the debate moderators asked a question regarding one of his platforms, Shaheen spoke briefly about why students run for Senate and how he plans to become more involved with campus issues.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhy do people run for Senate?,\\u201d Shaheen said. \\u201cI think that that answer isn\\u2019t always very clear when you think about what you can also achieve as just an individual student in the process of learning more about ASUCD and about how this school works and preparing yourself to become a better candidate in the future and I just decided that that\\u2019s what I want to do. I\\u2019m going to withdraw myself, and I implore all of you to please pass your votes to these other candidates. I intend to spend the next several months learning more about ASUCD, learning more about this school, networking with people so hopefully I can become a candidate that you deserve better in the future.

Their concern was that it may be referencing the incident at the mosque on Russell Boulevard.

The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three. &#39;, u&#39;This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehi\\u2019s &#39;, &#39; last year, where she faced a series of controversies including &#39;, &#39; on two for-profit boards.&#39;, u&#39;Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and women\\u2019s studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators \\u201cinsurance\\u201d and hide their mistakes.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cKatehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so,\\u201d Fox said. \\u201cBy them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesn\\u2019t look bad for the UC as a whole. [\\u2026] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIf Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there aren\\u2019t conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cEverything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC,\\u201d Fox said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIf the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cTheir actions are more egregious.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part,\\u201d Breuninger said. \\u201cThis is something that\\u2019s in the public eye right now, so I don\\u2019t have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they won\\u2019t go straight back to their usual operation.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The UC Davis and UC Office of the President\\u2019s media relations did not respond to &#39;, u&#39;\\u2019s request for comments regarding the intentions of the new policies.&#39;][&#39;On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).&#39;, &#39;Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining.&#39;, &#39;As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agency\\u2019s statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project,\\u201d the notice read. \\u201cResponses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28.&#39;, &#39;ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students.&#39;, &#39;Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhat the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low,\\u201d Martinez said. \\u201cSo the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times can\\u2019t find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and it\\u2019s just, it\\u2019s not a good mix when it comes to housing.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018.&#39;, &#39;ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI definitely think that the issue of housing isn\\u2019t going away anytime soon,\\u201d Lee said. \\u201cThe issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, it\\u2019s going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of it\\u2019s population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasn\\u2019t always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and it\\u2019s not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding,\\u201d Martinez said. \\u201cSo I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they haven\\u2019t been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;The University of California\\u2019s 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25. The 2016 report relays both the UC\\u2019s successes and challenges ahead in regards to renewable energy, water conservation, waste reduction, food sustainability and UC-wide sustainability goals.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe\\u2019re attacking this challenge on multiple fronts \\u2014 undertaking basic and applied research, teaching, changing the way we operate, investing in climate change solutions and being a model of positive change,\\u201d said UC President Janet Napolitano in the report.&#39;, u&#39;The report highlights UC Davis\\u2019 implementation of its 16.3 MW large solar power plant, the largest known on any university campus, which generates approximately 33 million kilowatt hours for the campus and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 14,000 metric tons annually.&#39;, &#39;UC Davis has been consistently meeting or approaching UC-wide sustainability goals. The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early.&#39;, &#39;Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [\\u2026] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year,\\u201d Kirk said via email.&#39;, &#39;Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cStudent activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero,\\u201d Knox said via email. \\u201cIn 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPreparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative,\\u201d Napolitano said in the report.&#39;, &#39;UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cHere at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere,\\u201d Knox said via email. \\u201cStudents can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects.&#39;, &#39;ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017.&#39;, &#39;UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, &#39;, &#39;which &#39;, &#39;they were supposed to stay under until 2020. &#39;, &#39;In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025.&#39;, &#39;More information regarding the &#39;, &#39;2016 Annual Report on Sustainability can be found on its &#39;, &#39;. Interested individuals can also look at a sustainability &#39;, &#39; of UC Davis.&#39;][u&#39;In a packed main lobby of the UC Davis International Center, UC Davis Global Affairs hosted a discussion on Feb. 2 concerning President Donald Trump\\u2019s executive orders on immigration. &#39;, &#39;This order, one of the more infamous of the ones President Trump has signed thus far, bans travel of persons from seven Muslim-majority nations. However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cRecent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values \\u2014 values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings,\\u201d Regulska said. \\u201cThree recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThese three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [\\u2026] attempt to destroy our community fabric,\\u201d Regulska said. \\u201cThey also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhy are so many who aren\\u2019t directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness?\\u201d Hexter asked the audience, according to &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cPart of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are \\u2014 and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, it\\u2019s difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trump\\u2019s executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law.&#39;, u&#39;Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students\\u2019 families as well.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students,\\u201d Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. \\u201cOur target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method \\u2014 they can contact us [\\u2026] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if you\\u2019re a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure,\\u201d Regulska said.&#39;, &#39;Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOn a personal note, as in immigrant to this country many years ago when I left communist Poland, it is especially painful to me to see state institutions adopting oppressive and authoritarian practices,\\u201d Regulska said.&#39;][&#39;President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States.&#39;, u&#39;On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, \\u201cso long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled,\\u201d according to a &#39;, &#39; 60,000 visas were cancelled.&#39;, u&#39; \\u201cI am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas,\\u201d said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his &#39;, u&#39; to the campus community. \\u201cThis situation touches us closely.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThere seems to be some ambiguity as to whether I\\u2019d be allowed to return,\\u201d Hamidian said in an interview with &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cUC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City,\\u201d said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his &#39;, &#39; to the community. &#39;, &#39;He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.&#39;, u&#39; Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a master\\u2019s program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application.&#39;, &#39;On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives.&#39;, &#39;In an &#39;, &#39;, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201c&#39;, u&#39;There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldn\\u2019t attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home,\\u201d &#39;, &#39;said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering. &#39;, u&#39;An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now \\u201cthere is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The anonymous student also said that \\u201cthere are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPutting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now,\\u201d White said. \\u201cIran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [\\u2026] dealing with something similar. We\\u2019ve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships it\\u2019s causing, but it\\u2019s also having broader impacts.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhile maintaining the security of the nation\\u2019s visa system is critical, this executive order is contrary to the values we hold dear as leaders of the University of California,\\u201d read a &#39;, u&#39;, signed by the UC President and 10 Chancellors. \\u201cThe UC community, like universities across the country, has long been deeply enriched by students, faculty and scholars from around the world, including the affected countries, coming to study, teach and research.\\u201d \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;\\xa0&#39;][&#39;UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale &#39;, &#39;, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL. &#39;, u&#39;The students met at the Memorial Union \\xa0flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims. &#39;, u&#39;Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industry\\u2019s project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River,\\u201d Ferreyra said. \\u201cAnd if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;The pipeline\\u2019s potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested. Last month, it was &#39;, &#39; that the University of California Retirement Plan, managed by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents, currently holds bonds in Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t make sense for one of the leading climate science institutions in America to invest in an industry that is killing the earth,\\u201d said Hanna Presiado, a first-year environmental science and management major. &#39;, &#39;With President Donald &#39;, u&#39; advancing the approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, as he promised during his campaign, some students feel that the current administration\\u2019s stance on environmental policy does not reflect the will of the people and will be detrimental for future generations. &#39;, u&#39;Josh Wertheim, a third-year anthropology major who participated in the protests at Standing Rock in North Dakota, expressed his concern for the environment and the pipeline\\u2019s impact on future generations.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis is our world and we borrow the world from the future,\\u201d Wertheim said.&#39;, &#39; The &#39;, &#39; as Secretary of State has also riled supporters of environmental sustainability.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cTrump\\u2019s corporate colonial cabinet is hard at work ensuring that students like us will have no planet to enact our education onto,\\u201d Ferrerya said. \\u201cClimate denialism kills, and the fact that our Secretary of State is a former CEO of the largest oil company in the world is a sobering reminder that the climate catastrophe will only get worse unless the people can successfully step in.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;UC Davis held its first mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday Feb. 7. Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities. &#39;, &#39;After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma. &#39;, &#39;The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change,\\u201d Ruttkay said via email.&#39;, u&#39;Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the university\\u2019s colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future. &#39;, &#39;Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences,\\u201d Olivan said. \\u201cIt definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as \\u201cnormal,\\u201d while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people. &#39;, &#39;Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means,\\u201d Olivan said. &#39;, &#39;Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended. &#39;, &#39;After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful,\\u201d Ruttkay said. &#39;, &#39;Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me,\\u201d Ruttkay said. \\u201cI was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego. &#39;, &#39;Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers. &#39;, &#39;The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadn\\u2019t anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times,\\u201d Chiang said via email.&#39;, &#39;Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference. &#39;, &#39;Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cA great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy,\\u201d Olivan said.&#39;, &#39;Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level,\\u201d Ruttkay said.&#39;, &#39;Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe\\u2019re looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health,\\u201d Grady said via email. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus.\\u201d &#39;][&#39;After five years of providing business to students and locals of Davis, the Whole Foods Market on 1st Street closed on Sunday, Feb. 12. The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.&#39;, u&#39;The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Food\\u2019s locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joe\\u2019s and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.&#39;, &#39;Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \\u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThat\\u2019s why it closed down \\u2013\\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \\u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\\u2019s, to grow.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI\\u2019d love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city \\u2013\\u2013 it\\u2019s something that we critically need,\\u201d said Mayor Robb Davis.&#39;, &#39;And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt just feels out of place, not having a Whole Foods in Davis,\\u201d Pasturel said.&#39;][u&#39;Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthood\\u2019s in-clinic abortion services. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for women\\u2019s rights. &#39;, u&#39;Over 80 individuals RSVP\\u2019d to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.&#39;, u&#39;This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as \\u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood\\u201d and \\u201cnot your body, not your business.\\u201d Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for women\\u2019s health,\\u201d said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. \\u201cIt provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;According to Planned Parenthood\\u2019s 2014-2015 &#39;, u&#39;, of the \\u201c9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. &#39;, &#39;Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cMy two daughters go to the clinic,\\u201d Rodriquez said. \\u201cTheir school is teaching them information about women\\u2019s health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, \\u201cHoly Mary, pray for our sinners.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;At UC Davis\\u2019 Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance. &#39;][&#39;The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the &#39;, &#39;Davis Joint Unified School District&#39;, &#39; or Yolo County services. &#39;, &#39;California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the state\\u2019s orders,\\u201d said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. \\u201cWe are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. &#39;, u&#39;Davis\\u2019 Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cDavis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall,\\u201d said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. \\u201cLocated at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. &#39;, &#39;Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to &#39;, &#39;the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.&#39;, &#39;That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. &#39;, u&#39;While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the city\\u2019s Historic Resource Management Commission.&#39;, u&#39;While there hasn\\u2019t been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. &#39;, u&#39;Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the city\\u2019s history. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe have to demonstrate to the state that we are maximizing revenue from that sale,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cIt would be difficult for us to demonstrate that we are purchasing it at market [value] if we get it at a rate that we can potentially afford so we are unanimous in saying that it should be sold at market rate.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.&#39;, &#39;Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the &#39;, u&#39;, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administration\\u2019s list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.&#39;, u&#39;In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community,\\u201d said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.&#39;, &#39;In the wake of a &#39;, u&#39; at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading \\u201cwe support you.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before,\\u201d Mansuri said. \\u201cThere is no longer this predominating attitude that, \\u2018well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion\\u2019.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.&#39;, u&#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, \\u201cUC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThere is still a lot of hateful sentiment,\\u201d Mansuri said. \\u201cThis weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\\u201d Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.&#39;, u&#39;On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with \\u201cvery little changes.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAfter you reach out, get involved,\\u201d Mansuri said. \\u201cAttend events, talks, panels, protests, and educate yourself. There is no shortage of people to talk to. Do not be shy. Be open minded and open hearted.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units,\\u201d said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. &#39;, &#39;With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\\u201d Gilbert said. &#39;, &#39;To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. &#39;, &#39;In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. &#39;, &#39;Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. &#39;, &#39;According to the CalRecycle&#39;, u&#39;, \\u201cDuring the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. &#39;, &#39;Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\\u201d said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.&#39;, u&#39;To help the campus reach its goal, Vang recommended that students make an effort to compost more \\u2014 not just food, but napkins and other items as well. She\\u2019s hoping that she can bring more composting collection services to the Coffee House later this spring. &#39;][&#39;Feb. 6&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cChronic phone problem.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Feb. 7&#39;, u&#39;Person \\u201cnot making any sense.\\u201d May be \\u201cdue to intoxication.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Feb. 8&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cRecorded phone call from male that asked multiple questions about massages.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Feb. 8&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cSedan occupied by male with female in passenger seat bent over in his lap.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Feb. 10&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cResident sounds like she\\u2019s dropping a heavy item repeatedly onto the floor for the past several minutes.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Feb. 10&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cFour outdoor ATM machines appeared to have white soapy powder and water sprayed directly into card reader.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Feb. 11&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cChicken trying to cross the road, loitering around the center divide area.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;\\xa0\\u2014&#39;][u&#39;President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as \\u201csanctuary jurisdictions.\\u201d \\u201cSanctuary jurisdiction\\u201d is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies.&#39;, u&#39;The controversial executive order, titled \\u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\\u201d was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.&#39;, &#39;The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city&#39;, &#39;, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&#39;, u&#39;Davis explained that the City of Davis\\u2019 sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\\u2019s [immigration] status in any interaction [\\u2026] This is something that we\\u2019ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\\u2019re not fearful of contacting the police,\\u201d Davis said. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;Davis believes that President Trump\\u2019s executive order will make cities less safe.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cImagine if you\\u2019re someone who is brought to this country, and you\\u2019ve been trafficked and you\\u2019re not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trump\\u2019s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\\u201d Davis said.&#39;, &#39;According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\\u2019re acting,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have any concerns about the administration\\u2019s threats [\\u2026] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke&#39;, u&#39; We\\u2019re not in a position where we\\u2019re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\\u2019 affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\\u2019s the President of the United States. It\\u2019s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \\u2018no, we\\u2019re not going to pass any of his bills\\u2019 [\\u2026] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\\u201d Casas said.&#39;, u&#39;Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\\u2019 stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cFor somebody to come around asking random questions like \\u2018Hey, are you a citizen here?\\u2019 It\\u2019s kind of none of their business. If they\\u2019re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\\u2019t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\\u2019m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [\\u2026] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\\u201d Angel-Gonzalez said.&#39;, &#39;Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis &#39;, &#39; by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&#39;, u&#39;The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\\u2019s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\\u2019s license without proof of legal residence. &#39;, &#39;The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.&#39;, u&#39;The legality of President Trump\\u2019s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.&#39;][&#39;Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism &#39;, &#39;, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. &#39;, u&#39;The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \\u201cSoon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement.

The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe grant was wonderful and very generous,\\u201d said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \\u201cIt does not cover the total cost of the program, however.

The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.&#39;, &#39;In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.&#39;, &#39;Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.&#39;, &#39;Janet Foley, a &#39;, &#39;professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\\u201d Foley said. &#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.&#39;, u&#39;The complaint called into question the city council\\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \\u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\u2019 leadership. The council\\u2019s MND called for \\u201cpassive relocation\\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPassive relocation\\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \\u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. &#39;, &#39;The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.&#39;, u&#39;According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \\u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\\u201d \\xa0&#39;, &#39;Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event.

The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.&#39;, u&#39;The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Food\\u2019s locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joe\\u2019s and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.&#39;, &#39;Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \\u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThat\\u2019s why it closed down \\u2013\\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \\u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\\u2019s, to grow.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI\\u2019d love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city \\u2013\\u2013 it\\u2019s something that we critically need,\\u201d said Mayor Robb Davis.&#39;, &#39;And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt just feels out of place, not having a Whole Foods in Davis,\\u201d Pasturel said.&#39;][u&#39;Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthood\\u2019s in-clinic abortion services. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for women\\u2019s rights. &#39;, u&#39;Over 80 individuals RSVP\\u2019d to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.&#39;, u&#39;This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as \\u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood\\u201d and \\u201cnot your body, not your business.\\u201d Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for women\\u2019s health,\\u201d said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. \\u201cIt provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;According to Planned Parenthood\\u2019s 2014-2015 &#39;, u&#39;, of the \\u201c9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. &#39;, &#39;Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cMy two daughters go to the clinic,\\u201d Rodriquez said. \\u201cTheir school is teaching them information about women\\u2019s health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, \\u201cHoly Mary, pray for our sinners.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;At UC Davis\\u2019 Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance. &#39;][&#39;The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the &#39;, &#39;Davis Joint Unified School District&#39;, &#39; or Yolo County services. &#39;, &#39;California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the state\\u2019s orders,\\u201d said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. \\u201cWe are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. &#39;, u&#39;Davis\\u2019 Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cDavis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall,\\u201d said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. \\u201cLocated at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. &#39;, &#39;Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to &#39;, &#39;the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.&#39;, &#39;That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. &#39;, u&#39;While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the city\\u2019s Historic Resource Management Commission.&#39;, u&#39;While there hasn\\u2019t been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. &#39;, u&#39;Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the city\\u2019s history. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe have to demonstrate to the state that we are maximizing revenue from that sale,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cIt would be difficult for us to demonstrate that we are purchasing it at market [value] if we get it at a rate that we can potentially afford so we are unanimous in saying that it should be sold at market rate.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.&#39;, &#39;Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the &#39;, u&#39;, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis.

Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\\u201d Gilbert said. &#39;, &#39;To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. &#39;, &#39;In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. &#39;, &#39;Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. &#39;, &#39;According to the CalRecycle&#39;, u&#39;, \\u201cDuring the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. &#39;, &#39;Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\\u201d said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.&#39;, u&#39;To help the campus reach its goal, Vang recommended that students make an effort to compost more \\u2014 not just food, but napkins and other items as well.

Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.&#39;, &#39;The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city&#39;, &#39;, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&#39;, u&#39;Davis explained that the City of Davis\\u2019 sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\\u2019s [immigration] status in any interaction [\\u2026] This is something that we\\u2019ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\\u2019re not fearful of contacting the police,\\u201d Davis said. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;Davis believes that President Trump\\u2019s executive order will make cities less safe.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cImagine if you\\u2019re someone who is brought to this country, and you\\u2019ve been trafficked and you\\u2019re not here legally.

So I believe that this action [Trump\\u2019s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\\u201d Davis said.&#39;, &#39;According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\\u2019re acting,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have any concerns about the administration\\u2019s threats [\\u2026] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke&#39;, u&#39; We\\u2019re not in a position where we\\u2019re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\\u2019 affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\\u2019s the President of the United States. It\\u2019s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \\u2018no, we\\u2019re not going to pass any of his bills\\u2019 [\\u2026] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\\u201d Casas said.&#39;, u&#39;Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\\u2019 stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cFor somebody to come around asking random questions like \\u2018Hey, are you a citizen here?\\u2019 It\\u2019s kind of none of their business. If they\\u2019re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\\u2019t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\\u2019m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [\\u2026] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\\u201d Angel-Gonzalez said.&#39;, &#39;Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis &#39;, &#39; by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&#39;, u&#39;The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\\u2019s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\\u2019s license without proof of legal residence. &#39;, &#39;The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.&#39;, u&#39;The legality of President Trump\\u2019s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.&#39;][&#39;Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism &#39;, &#39;, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. &#39;, u&#39;The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \\u201cSoon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement.

Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis really isn\\u2019t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\\u201d Williams said in an interview with The &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cWhat happens if we extend the sales tax?

The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe grant was wonderful and very generous,\\u201d said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \\u201cIt does not cover the total cost of the program, however.

Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesn\\u2019t affect patients\\u2019 ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cYou figure out an individual\\u2019s specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre,\\u201d said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. \\u201cIt\\u2019s more about them connecting to their past in their music.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Although music isn\\u2019t said to be a complete cure for Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia, it does help \\xa0bring some of the patients\\u2019 memories back for the time being.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201c[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed,\\u201d Johnston said. \\u201cMedication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective.

The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.&#39;, &#39;In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.&#39;, &#39;Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.&#39;, &#39;Janet Foley, a &#39;, &#39;professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\\u201d Foley said. &#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.&#39;, u&#39;The complaint called into question the city council\\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \\u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\u2019 leadership. The council\\u2019s MND called for \\u201cpassive relocation\\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPassive relocation\\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \\u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. &#39;, &#39;The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.&#39;, u&#39;According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \\u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\\u201d \\xa0&#39;, &#39;Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event.

Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.&#39;, &#39;Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \\u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThat\\u2019s why it closed down \\u2013\\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \\u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\\u2019s, to grow.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI\\u2019d love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city \\u2013\\u2013 it\\u2019s something that we critically need,\\u201d said Mayor Robb Davis.&#39;, &#39;And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt just feels out of place, not having a Whole Foods in Davis,\\u201d Pasturel said.&#39;][u&#39;Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthood\\u2019s in-clinic abortion services. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for women\\u2019s rights. &#39;, u&#39;Over 80 individuals RSVP\\u2019d to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.&#39;, u&#39;This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as \\u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood\\u201d and \\u201cnot your body, not your business.\\u201d Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for women\\u2019s health,\\u201d said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. \\u201cIt provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;According to Planned Parenthood\\u2019s 2014-2015 &#39;, u&#39;, of the \\u201c9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. &#39;, &#39;Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cMy two daughters go to the clinic,\\u201d Rodriquez said. \\u201cTheir school is teaching them information about women\\u2019s health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, \\u201cHoly Mary, pray for our sinners.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;At UC Davis\\u2019 Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance. &#39;][&#39;The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the &#39;, &#39;Davis Joint Unified School District&#39;, &#39; or Yolo County services. &#39;, &#39;California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the state\\u2019s orders,\\u201d said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. \\u201cWe are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. &#39;, u&#39;Davis\\u2019 Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cDavis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall,\\u201d said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. \\u201cLocated at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. &#39;, &#39;Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to &#39;, &#39;the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.&#39;, &#39;That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. &#39;, u&#39;While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the city\\u2019s Historic Resource Management Commission.&#39;, u&#39;While there hasn\\u2019t been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. &#39;, u&#39;Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the city\\u2019s history. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe have to demonstrate to the state that we are maximizing revenue from that sale,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cIt would be difficult for us to demonstrate that we are purchasing it at market [value] if we get it at a rate that we can potentially afford so we are unanimous in saying that it should be sold at market rate.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.&#39;, &#39;Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the &#39;, u&#39;, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administration\\u2019s list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.&#39;, u&#39;In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community,\\u201d said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.&#39;, &#39;In the wake of a &#39;, u&#39; at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading \\u201cwe support you.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before,\\u201d Mansuri said. \\u201cThere is no longer this predominating attitude that, \\u2018well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion\\u2019.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.&#39;, u&#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, \\u201cUC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThere is still a lot of hateful sentiment,\\u201d Mansuri said. \\u201cThis weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State. President Trump responded in a series of tweets and Facebook statements criticizing the appeals. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\\u201d Trump tweeted, following the initial freeze of the travel ban.&#39;, u&#39;On Feb. 10, the president was also quoted saying that he plans to file a new executive order with \\u201cvery little changes.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Despite the actions taken by the President, students and residents urge each other to remain informed and ready to support those affected by new developments. Mansuri urges nonmuslims to reach out to their muslim friends in this time of need.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAfter you reach out, get involved,\\u201d Mansuri said. \\u201cAttend events, talks, panels, protests, and educate yourself. There is no shortage of people to talk to. Do not be shy. Be open minded and open hearted.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units,\\u201d said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. &#39;, &#39;With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\\u201d Gilbert said. &#39;, &#39;To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. &#39;, &#39;In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. &#39;, &#39;Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. &#39;, &#39;According to the CalRecycle&#39;, u&#39;, \\u201cDuring the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. &#39;, &#39;Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\\u201d said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.&#39;, u&#39;To help the campus reach its goal, Vang recommended that students make an effort to compost more \\u2014 not just food, but napkins and other items as well.

Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.&#39;, &#39;The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city&#39;, &#39;, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&#39;, u&#39;Davis explained that the City of Davis\\u2019 sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\\u2019s [immigration] status in any interaction [\\u2026] This is something that we\\u2019ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\\u2019re not fearful of contacting the police,\\u201d Davis said. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;Davis believes that President Trump\\u2019s executive order will make cities less safe.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cImagine if you\\u2019re someone who is brought to this country, and you\\u2019ve been trafficked and you\\u2019re not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trump\\u2019s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\\u201d Davis said.&#39;, &#39;According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\\u2019re acting,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have any concerns about the administration\\u2019s threats [\\u2026] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke&#39;, u&#39; We\\u2019re not in a position where we\\u2019re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\\u2019 affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\\u2019s the President of the United States. It\\u2019s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \\u2018no, we\\u2019re not going to pass any of his bills\\u2019 [\\u2026] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\\u201d Casas said.&#39;, u&#39;Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\\u2019 stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cFor somebody to come around asking random questions like \\u2018Hey, are you a citizen here?\\u2019 It\\u2019s kind of none of their business. If they\\u2019re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\\u2019t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\\u2019m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [\\u2026] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\\u201d Angel-Gonzalez said.&#39;, &#39;Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis &#39;, &#39; by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&#39;, u&#39;The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\\u2019s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\\u2019s license without proof of legal residence. &#39;, &#39;The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.&#39;, u&#39;The legality of President Trump\\u2019s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.&#39;][&#39;Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism &#39;, &#39;, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. &#39;, u&#39;The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \\u201cSoon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement.

This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. &#39;, u&#39; have shown that patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.&#39;, &#39;In order to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe grant was wonderful and very generous,\\u201d said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \\u201cIt does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesn\\u2019t affect patients\\u2019 ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cYou figure out an individual\\u2019s specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre,\\u201d said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. \\u201cIt\\u2019s more about them connecting to their past in their music.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Although music isn\\u2019t said to be a complete cure for Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia, it does help \\xa0bring some of the patients\\u2019 memories back for the time being.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201c[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed,\\u201d Johnston said. \\u201cMedication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;The Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAlive Inside\\u201d is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music &amp; Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves.

The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.&#39;, &#39;In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.&#39;, &#39;Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.&#39;, &#39;Janet Foley, a &#39;, &#39;professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\\u201d Foley said. &#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.&#39;, u&#39;The complaint called into question the city council\\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \\u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\u2019 leadership. The council\\u2019s MND called for \\u201cpassive relocation\\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPassive relocation\\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \\u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. &#39;, &#39;The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.&#39;, u&#39;According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \\u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\\u201d \\xa0&#39;, &#39;Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event.

The Davis location was one of nine Whole Foods Markets across the country to permanently close.&#39;, u&#39;The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Food\\u2019s locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joe\\u2019s and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.&#39;, &#39;Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \\u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThat\\u2019s why it closed down \\u2013\\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \\u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\\u2019s, to grow.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI\\u2019d love to have something in there that would generate sales tax revenue for the city \\u2013\\u2013 it\\u2019s something that we critically need,\\u201d said Mayor Robb Davis.&#39;, &#39;And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt just feels out of place, not having a Whole Foods in Davis,\\u201d Pasturel said.&#39;][u&#39;Over 100 protesters both for and against Planned Parenthood rallied outside of the Woodland clinic on Feb. 11 during a protest that was initially held to urge Congress and President Trump to defund the organization due to Planned Parenthood\\u2019s in-clinic abortion services. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;What was originally planned as a protest against Planned Parenthood quickly became an outnumbered protest featuring women, men and individuals of all ages, races and social backgrounds fighting for support of the organization and for women\\u2019s rights. &#39;, u&#39;Over 80 individuals RSVP\\u2019d to the Woodland Facebook event that hosted the counter protests in support of Planned Parenthood, but estimates made by ralliers in attendance were closer to 150 people, with some showing up as early as 8 a.m.&#39;, u&#39;This event in Woodland was just one of five rallies held in the greater Sacramento region, with more than 225 rallies held at Planned Parenthood locations across 45 states nationwide. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;In Woodland, those who rallied in support of the organization carried banners and placards with slogans saying things such as \\u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood\\u201d and \\u201cnot your body, not your business.\\u201d Many men and women also wore pink to show their solidarity with the national health care provider. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI support the clinic because it provides services that are needed for women\\u2019s health,\\u201d said Paul Wilson, a rallier in attendance at the Woodland event. \\u201cIt provides mostly services for disease, reproductive and sexual health, and other complications. There are very few abortions, so it is incorrect to label it as an abortion clinic.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;According to Planned Parenthood\\u2019s 2014-2015 &#39;, u&#39;, of the \\u201c9,455,582 total services that were offered during that year, 323,999 services, about 3% of the total provided, went toward abortions procedures.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;A majority of the services that Planned Parenthood provides go toward birth control information and sexual health and disease tests and treatment. &#39;, &#39;Yolanda Rodriquez, a rallier in support of funding for Planned Parenthood, was also in attendance with her 17-year old daughter, Holly Gainez, to speak out about the organization and the services it provides for her family and for the public. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cMy two daughters go to the clinic,\\u201d Rodriquez said. \\u201cTheir school is teaching them information about women\\u2019s health, so they know that they have a safe place to go to. [Planned Parenthood] is here to help teach our children, to help protect them.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Those not in support of Planned Parenthood were also present at the Woodland event, though significantly fewer in number. Californians for Life, a social justice organization that fights to end abortion in the state, sponsored the protest Planned Parenthood event in Woodland. There was also a quiet praying vigil of three women and two children who stood by venue and repeated a short verse, \\u201cHoly Mary, pray for our sinners.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;At UC Davis\\u2019 Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), where health care providers offer a number of different medical, mental health and wellness services to students, abortion services are &#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;Instead, their webpage suggests that if students are in need of abortion services, they can speak with a provider at SHCS where they may be referred to Sutter Davis Hospital, a provider in their associated insurance network, or to Planned Parenthood for further assistance. &#39;][&#39;The City of Davis must sell its Historic City Hall due to a statewide call for cities to dissolve any properties formerly funded by the Redevelopment Agency (RDA), which dissolved in February of 2012. The state hopes to return the property taxes to public agencies within Davis, such as the &#39;, &#39;Davis Joint Unified School District&#39;, &#39; or Yolo County services. &#39;, &#39;California has distributed money to revitalizing broken-down cities, and, while some cities desperately needed the funds, cities like Davis used them for less dire projects. The city chose to invest in properties like the Historic City Hall, the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, the Dresbach-Hunt Boyer Mansion and the parking garage above the Regal Holiday Cinema.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe state wanted [the money given to the cities by the RDA] back so we are complying with the state\\u2019s orders,\\u201d said Brett Lee, Davis city councilmember. \\u201cWe are going to put it out on the open market and see who bids for it.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;The state looked through all of the properties that stemmed from finances provided by the RDA and allowed for cities to retain ownership of properties that still serve public and/or government use. &#39;, u&#39;Davis\\u2019 Historic City Hall, however, now houses a restaurant and bar, which does not necessarily serve any type of public service. As a result, the state now requires that Davis put the property on the open market.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cDavis has initiated the early stages of marketing for its historic city hall,\\u201d said Stacey Winton, a City of Davis media and communications officer. \\u201cLocated at 226 F. St., the vacant building has not been used for city affairs but contains a restaurant, Bistro 33, in both the building and outside patio. &#39;, &#39;Despite losing ownership of the property, the city will gain access to bond funds from the state once it is sold. Once the real estate has been dissolved, the city will also receive 21 percent of the proceeds, with 33.5 percent going to &#39;, &#39;the Davis Joint Unified School District, 25 percent to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and the remainder to be dispersed among various organizations like the Yolo County Library and the Davis Cemetery District.&#39;, &#39;That process is now underway with the city looking to hire a commercial broker by this spring. &#39;, u&#39;While the new owner will gain rights to the property, the building is deemed a historical landmark. Therefore, no major structural changes can be made without first consulting the council and the city\\u2019s Historic Resource Management Commission.&#39;, u&#39;While there hasn\\u2019t been an official appraisal of the property, the council estimates its value to be about $2.3 million. This number is too high for the City of Davis to consider investing in the property, according to city officials. &#39;, u&#39;Mayor Robb Davis noted that the city will not seek to obtain the building. Although the decision and process has been difficult for the city, there are limited options. The building will remain in the public sphere and will continue to be valued as a historical space and part of the city\\u2019s history. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe have to demonstrate to the state that we are maximizing revenue from that sale,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cIt would be difficult for us to demonstrate that we are purchasing it at market [value] if we get it at a rate that we can potentially afford so we are unanimous in saying that it should be sold at market rate.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;On his seventh day in office, when President Trump signed his thirteenth executive order which imposes an immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations, Muslims and non-Muslims alike across the U.S. cried out against the order.&#39;, &#39;Of the 37 percent of Davis residents that consider themselves religious, roughly 2.3 percent of permanent residents are of the &#39;, u&#39;, in addition to the large portion of Muslim students attending UC Davis. As a result of the diversity at UC Davis beyond the considerable Muslim population, a long-standing tradition of activism on campus and around the community has developed. The recent election has already had an effect on students and residents of Davis, who seem to have readied themselves for the new administration\\u2019s list of policies by vocalizing possible concerns that may arise in the next four years.&#39;, u&#39;In light of the Executive Order barring residents of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Davis has responded with solidarity which speaks volumes. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI have noticed an outpour of support for the Muslim community,\\u201d said Noreen Mansuri, a third-year neurology, physiology and behavior major and a Muslim student and activist.&#39;, &#39;In the wake of a &#39;, u&#39; at the Islamic Center of Davis, hundreds of members of the Davis community gathered in Central Park to show their support of the Muslim community. Signs and banners have been hung in front of the Islamic Center, covered in signatures from numerous members of the community and reading \\u201cwe support you.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cI do not think there is as much detachment as there has been before,\\u201d Mansuri said. \\u201cThere is no longer this predominating attitude that, \\u2018well, it does not directly affect me, so I do not really have an opinion\\u2019.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Almost $20,000 was donated to the Islamic Center via an online Kickstarter to help compensate for broken windows, destroyed bicycles and door handles wrapped in raw bacon. Several organizations have offered rewards of over $1,000 in return for the identity of the vandal.&#39;, u&#39;Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a joint statement responding to the incident with Mayor Robb Davis and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Adela de la Torre which stated, \\u201cUC Davis and the City of Davis are home to people of the Muslim faith from around the world. Each one enriches our lives and brings new perspectives to our community. We will continue our work to support and protect them and to stand against those seeking to sow fear.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Although support for the Muslim community continues, there is still no shortage of negativity, according to Mansuri.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThere is still a lot of hateful sentiment,\\u201d Mansuri said. \\u201cThis weekend I received an alert that a box of pork tenderloins was left outside of an apartment known to be home to Muslim students.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;On Feb. 3, a federal judge issued a suspension on the order after the Attorney General in Washington state challenged the order. A request to reinstate the travel ban was blocked twice within a week afterward in San Francisco and Washington State.

Be open minded and open hearted.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units,\\u201d said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview. &#39;, &#39;With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\\u201d Gilbert said. &#39;, &#39;To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work. &#39;, &#39;In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state. &#39;, &#39;Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state. &#39;, &#39;According to the CalRecycle&#39;, u&#39;, \\u201cDuring the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\\u201d &#39;, &#39;Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach. &#39;, &#39;Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\\u201d said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.&#39;, u&#39;To help the campus reach its goal, Vang recommended that students make an effort to compost more \\u2014 not just food, but napkins and other items as well.

Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies.&#39;, &#39;The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city&#39;, &#39;, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&#39;, u&#39;Davis explained that the City of Davis\\u2019 sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\\u2019s [immigration] status in any interaction [\\u2026] This is something that we\\u2019ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\\u2019re not fearful of contacting the police,\\u201d Davis said. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;Davis believes that President Trump\\u2019s executive order will make cities less safe.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cImagine if you\\u2019re someone who is brought to this country, and you\\u2019ve been trafficked and you\\u2019re not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trump\\u2019s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\\u201d Davis said.&#39;, &#39;According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOur police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\\u2019re acting,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have any concerns about the administration\\u2019s threats [\\u2026] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke&#39;, u&#39; We\\u2019re not in a position where we\\u2019re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\\u2019 affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\\u2019s the President of the United States. It\\u2019s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \\u2018no, we\\u2019re not going to pass any of his bills\\u2019 [\\u2026] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\\u201d Casas said.&#39;, u&#39;Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\\u2019 stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cFor somebody to come around asking random questions like \\u2018Hey, are you a citizen here?\\u2019 It\\u2019s kind of none of their business. If they\\u2019re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\\u2019t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\\u2019m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [\\u2026] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\\u201d Angel-Gonzalez said.&#39;, &#39;Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis &#39;, &#39; by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&#39;, u&#39;The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\\u2019s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\\u2019s license without proof of legal residence. &#39;, &#39;The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later.&#39;, u&#39;The legality of President Trump\\u2019s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.&#39;][&#39;Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism &#39;, &#39;, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI. &#39;, u&#39;The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \\u201cSoon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelho\\u2019s arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. \\xa0&#39;, &#39;The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cVideo footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle,\\u201d said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release.&#39;, u&#39;Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPolitical, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes,\\u201d said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest. &#39;, &#39; Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOn behalf of the Muslim community in Davis, we would like to thank you for your contribution to help repair our Masjid,\\u201d said Omar Awad, UC Davis Muslim Student Association president and Shifa Community Clinic volunteer, on the &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cWe are overwhelmed by your generosity as well as the amount of love and support that we have received in the past 72 hours.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;To increase transparency between the city\\u2019s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. &#39;, u&#39;Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\\u2019 Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cCity staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\\u2019s potential financial position over the long term,\\u201d Stachowicz said in an email interview. \\u201cWe all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Project Toto complements the city\\u2019s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\\u2019s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand.&#39;, u&#39;The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\\u2019s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis really isn\\u2019t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\\u201d Williams said in an interview with The &#39;, u&#39;. \\u201cWhat happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. &#39;, &#39;The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt\\u2019s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\\u201d Mayor Robb Davis said. \\u201cYou can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\\u2019s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. &#39;, &#39;There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt\\u2019s something I have been very much supportive of,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cTransparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [\\u2026] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;Jan. 29&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cLoud music or TV \\u2013\\u2013 reporting party has gone over twice but they keep turning up the volume.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Jan. 30&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cStatic on the line \\u2013\\u2013 tried to contact via cell but no answer and unable to leave message \\u2013\\u2013 last call advised having phone problems due to tree knocking out phone lines.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Feb. 3&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cReporting party\\u2019s roommate punched the wall to the apartment, was very upset but won\\u2019t tell why he is so upset parties are separated but in the apartment at this time.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cOngoing issue with parents parking in the white zone during student pick-up \\u2013\\u2013 required extra traffic control in the afternoon.\\u201d&#39;][u&#39;Who said that Valentine\\u2019s Day is limited to young lovers?

This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. &#39;, u&#39; have shown that patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories.&#39;, &#39;In order to become a Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThe grant was wonderful and very generous,\\u201d said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \\u201cIt does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesn\\u2019t affect patients\\u2019 ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cYou figure out an individual\\u2019s specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre,\\u201d said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. \\u201cIt\\u2019s more about them connecting to their past in their music.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Although music isn\\u2019t said to be a complete cure for Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia, it does help \\xa0bring some of the patients\\u2019 memories back for the time being.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201c[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed,\\u201d Johnston said. \\u201cMedication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life.\\u201d &#39;, u&#39;The Music &amp; Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimer\\u2019s or dementia.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cAlive Inside\\u201d is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music &amp; Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves.

The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.&#39;, &#39;In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.&#39;, &#39;Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.&#39;, &#39;Janet Foley, a &#39;, &#39;professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\\u201d Foley said. &#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\\u201d&#39;, &#39;Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.&#39;, u&#39;The complaint called into question the city council\\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \\u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\u2019 leadership. The council\\u2019s MND called for \\u201cpassive relocation\\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cPassive relocation\\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. &#39;, u&#39;\\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \\u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\\u201d&#39;][&#39;On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King. &#39;, &#39;The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis.&#39;, u&#39;According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \\u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\\u201d \\xa0&#39;, &#39;Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cIt\\u2019s an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event,\\u201d Davis said.&#39;, u&#39;A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. \\xa0&#39;, u&#39;In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. King\\u2019s beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in today\\u2019s political environment.&#39;, u&#39;\\u201cToday\\u2019s theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action,\\u201d Lewis said. \\u201cFor, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, \\u2018Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.\\u2019\\u201d&#39;, u&#39;Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event.

<p>City news discusses quite frequently investigations that are happening within the town of Davis. I find it interesting that the bigram in the campus news page with the highest score is "name changed". It also appears that the city news page covers a lot of activity from the Davis city council. However the list is too long to see the full range of words and the corresponding frequency of the words. It appears that words such as "roommate", "dorm" appear more in the campus news articles, than in the city new articles which discusses "whole foods closing".</p>

<p>No. I found the frequency of names within the tokens in the text to be misleading of the actual text. Perhaps my code was just awful, but I found it difficult to see a lot of similarity between the texts of both the campus news and city news, as well as within the titles. I think to find 'similarity' it would have been helpful to implement a thesaures, and somehow anaylze the words from the text based off of the thesaures, then compare and contrast in the campus and city news.  Also, I think it is hard to deter a difference between the campus and city news because this is a college town and the city revolves around the university, many of the topics will overlap between them making it hard to differentiate from them sometimes. Overall, I think the Aggie would require quite a bit of cleaning to be used as a 'true' corpus, one of these acts would require all the names mentioned in the article to be removed.</p>
