    "    'text': u'Davis residents create financial model to make city\\'s financial state more transparent To increase transparency between the city\\'s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\\' Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. \"City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\\'s potential financial position over the long term,\" Stachowicz said in an email interview. \"We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\" Project Toto complements the city\\'s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\\'s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand. The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\\'s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments \"This really isn\\'t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\" Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. \"What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\" Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto. \"It\\'s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\" Mayor Robb Davis said. \"You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\" Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\\'s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. \"It\\'s something I have been very much supportive of,\" Davis said. \"Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [ ] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\" ',\n",

       "  ' in the U.S. Recently, the UC Newsroom investigated a similar and potentially just as dangerous contender that has joined the smoking room: electronic cigarettes.',\n",
       "  u'E-cigarettes, also known as vapes or e-hookahs, are devices that heat a nicotine-containing liquid into an aerosol that the user inhales. What many vapers may not realize is that, besides nicotine, e-cigarettes can contain potentially harmful ingredients including chemicals known to cause heart and lung disease, heavy metals, carcinogens and other ultrafine particles. Though advertised as \\u201c',\n",
       "  u'\\u201d by the e-cigarette industry, this couldn\\u2019t be further from the truth.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cWe are learning more about the health impacts of inhaling vapor, or aerosol and secondhand vapor,\\u201d said Elisa Tong, UC Davis assistant professor of general medicine who works with UC Quits, a tobacco cessation network across the five UC medical campuses. \\u201cIt is not water vapor but propylene glycol that contains other chemicals [nicotine, flavorings, additives] and particles.\\u201d',\n",
       "  'The sleek design and technological sophistication are just a couple of factors that contribute to a cloud of appeal and normalcy around the notorious e-cigarette. The media, which heavily influences the perception of products on the market, has also played a critical role in skyrocketing popularity.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cEvery single big tobacco company has at least one e-cigarette brand. Since e-cigarettes had not been regulated, they used many of the same advertising tactics that they did for cigarettes years ago,\\u201d Tong said. \\u201cCertainly this includes getting product placement and celebrity endorsements that are advertised through the media.\\u201d',\n",
       "  u'Along with this, a plethora of attractive flavors, such as \\u201cSmurf Cake\\u201d and \\u201cFruit Hoops,\\u201d often make it appear as though you are purchasing a pack of bubblegum rather than a harmful nicotine product. These flavors, though edible, can be harmful when inhaled. Diacetyl, a chemical linked to lung disease, is an example of a common flavorant in e-cigarettes, according to the ',\n",
       "  'Besides the negative long-term health effects, e-cigarettes also have explosive tendencies.',\n",

       "  u'Another indisputable problem with e-cigarettes is that they continue to fuel smokers\\u2019 nicotine addictions, an unfortunate effect considering that many try to use them to wean themselves off of traditional cigarettes.',\n",
       "  u'\\u201cA puff on an e-cigarette is not as dangerous as a puff on a regular cigarette,\\u201d said tobacco control activist Stanton Glantz.',\n",

       "   u'The Whole Foods Market in Davis was located in a small shopping center along with several other eateries. The closure was part of an evaluation nationwide to determine which Whole Food\\u2019s locations were underperforming. The local market faced competition from other supermarkets and stores in the city, such as Safeway, Trader Joe\\u2019s and the Davis Food Co-op. Whole Foods markets itself on its organic food that does not use artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners or hydrogenated fats. Although this is a healthy benefit, many students could not afford the price tag associated with the products.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cI think it affects students for the most part,\\u201d said John Tuquero, a Verizon Wireless employee in the shopping center in which Whole Foods was located.',\n",
       "   'Despite the fact that not all students or residents could afford the prices at Whole Foods, the store was a common location for students to grab a bite to eat while studying. ',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cIt saddens me that Whole Foods is closing because it\\u2019s not just a grocery store, but also an outing where people can connect together,\\u201d said Forrest Pasturel, a first-year environmental policy and analysis major and former employee at the Whole Foods in Los Altos. \\u201cIt was at a very convenient spot, and would have been near my future apartment.\\u201d ',\n",
       "   'However, others argue that people would go to Whole Foods but not actually purchase enough for the company to make a profit.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cThat\\u2019s why it closed down \\u2013\\u2013 people used [Whole Foods] as a hang out spot and not to purchase,\\u201d said Mike Silva, another Verizon Wireless store employee. \\u201c[Whole Foods closing] also provides more opportunity for local stores, like Trader Joe\\u2019s, to grow.\\u201d',\n",
       "   'Davis students, employers and residents are wondering what will move into the place of the Whole Foods on the Fulcrum Property. ',\n",

       "   'And, while some are hoping for an Apple store or another big corporate company, others want to keep the small-town college vibe by supporting smaller, locally-owned businesses. No matter what the market is replaced with, the closing of Whole Foods will have a lasting impact on the Davis community as a whole.',\n",

The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.',\n",
       "   'In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.',\n",
       "   'Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.',\n",

       "   'Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.',\n",
       "   u'The complaint called into question the city council\\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \\u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\\u201d',\n",
       "   u'BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\u2019 leadership. The council\\u2019s MND called for \\u201cpassive relocation\\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cPassive relocation\\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return.

       "   'A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.',\n",
       "   'In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.',\n",
       "   'Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.',\n",

Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\\u201d Foley said. ',\n",
       "   '\\n',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\\u201d',\n",
       "   'Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.',\n",
       "   u'The complaint called into question the city council\\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \\u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\\u201d',\n",
       "   u'BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\u2019 leadership. The council\\u2019s MND called for \\u201cpassive relocation\\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cPassive relocation\\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. ',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \\u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\\u201d'],\n",

       "   'A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.',\n",
       "   'In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.',\n",
       "   'Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.',\n",

       "   'professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\\u201d Foley said. ',\n",
       "   '\\n',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\\u201d',\n",
       "   'Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.',\n",
       "   u'The complaint called into question the city council\\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \\u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\\u201d',\n",
       "   u'BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\u2019 leadership. The council\\u2019s MND called for \\u201cpassive relocation\\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cPassive relocation\\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. ',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \\u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\\u201d'],\n",

The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.',\n",
       "   'In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought.',\n",
       "   'Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern.',\n",
       "   'Janet Foley, a ',\n",
       "   'professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cIn Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\\u201d Foley said. ',\n",
       "   '\\n',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cThis is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\\u2019s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\\u201d',\n",
       "   'Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise.',\n",
       "   u'The complaint called into question the city council\\u2019s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cWe are not opposed to the hotel,\\u201d said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \\u201cOur issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\\u201d',\n",
       "   u'BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\u2019 leadership. The council\\u2019s MND called for \\u201cpassive relocation\\u201d of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices.',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cPassive relocation\\u201d involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place. ',\n",
       "   u'\\u201cCity council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting\\u2026[that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\\u201d said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \\u201cWe believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\\u201d'],\n",

       "   u'According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \\u201cbuild a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\\u201d \\xa0',\n",

       "   u'\\u201cToday\\u2019s theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action,\\u201d Lewis said. \\u201cFor, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, \\u2018Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.\\u2019\\u201d',\n",
       "   u'Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event.

As a result, we have found unexpected conditions when we started opening up walls. Some challenges included finding space for new duct work between the confined space of the existing floor structures and new ceilings or \\\\xa0discovering data and electrical lines in walls and ceilings where we didn\\\\u2019t expect them.\\\\u201d']['Last month ASUCD President Alex Lee issued a series of vetoes on legislation passed by the student Senate, including a revision veto on a constitutional amendment to create a Judicial Council and a Judicial Council Oversight Committee (JCOC).', '\\\\n', 'Constitutional Amendment #50, authored by the Internal Affairs Commission (IAC) chair Nick Flores, was passed on Jan. 26 with a vote of 9-1-1. Senator Sofia Molodanof voted against the measure while Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstained.', '\\\\n', u'\\\\u201cASUCD Constitutional Amendment #49 was placed on the Fall 2016 ASUCD ballot and passed with an 86.49% affirmative vote, effectively dissolving the ASUCD Court,\\\\u201d Flores wrote in the amendment. \\\\u201cGiven the necessity for an adjudicating body in student government, this Amendment seeks to create a new, functioning Judicial Council in ASUCD. Additionally, this Amendment creates a Judicial Council Oversight Committee. This Committee, comprised of ASUCD officials from each branch of government, would maintain the power to either concur with or overrule the Judicial Council\\\\u2019s ruling.\\\\u201d', '\\\\n', 'The JCOC, which would have the power to overturn decisions by the Judicial Court by a two-thirds majority, would have consisted of three voting members, the ASUCD vice president, the chair of the Judicial Council and the chair of the IAC. ', '\\\\n', u'Lee\\\\u2019s revision of the amendment removed the proposition of the JCOC, saying that the Judicial Council should have final say on any ASUCD decision.', '\\\\n', u'\\\\u201cI am returning CA#50 with a veto and recommending deletion of JCOC because I believe an appellate jurisdiction for the appellate jurisdiction is redundant,\\\\u201d Lee said in a statement regarding his veto. \\\\u201cIf it is for this new Council to make judicial decisions under the Constitution, it does not make sense for another body to overturn their decisions.

It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks.

It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks.

It makes no sense to me that there is a mechanism for which the two other branches can just reassert their will. JCOC is the highest appellate power and thus the last word. So it makes no sense for the two branches to have the first and last word if you are seeking to have judicial checks.

The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings.', 'In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs.

Perhaps my code was just awful, but I found it difficult to see a lot of similarity between the texts of both the campus news and city news, as well as within the titles. I think to find 'similarity' it would have been helpful to implement a thesaures, and somehow anaylze the words from the text based off of the thesaures, then compare and contrast in the campus and city news.  Also, I think it is hard to deter a difference between the campus and city news because this is a college town and the city revolves around the university, many of the topics will overlap between them making it hard to differentiate from them sometimes. Overall, I think the Aggie would require quite a bit of cleaning to be used as a 'true' corpus, one of these acts would require all the names mentioned in the article to be removed."
